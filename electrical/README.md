# Electrical

The vehicle's electrical design: what is connected to what, and what carries the current.

**Status: 2026-10-02 — flown.** The board is **built and working**, every device on it
answers, the 3.3 V rail has been measured under load, and the board flew in both competition
descents on 2026-09-30 and survived both landings (see
[`analysis/flight-2026-09-30/`](../analysis/flight-2026-09-30/README.md)). A photograph of the
vehicle board, component side, is [`mechanical/photos/pcb-top.jpg`](../mechanical/photos/pcb-top.jpg):

The switch is a rocker ON/OFF on short leads outside the frame, not in the CAD cut-out.

*As written 2026-09-14:* the board is built and working, every device on it
answers, and the 3.3 V rail has been measured under load. The switch, the power LED and the
battery divider were fitted before submission; **the Schottky diode was not** (reported by the team, 2026-09-14).

| | |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **Signal wiring** | Complete and verified. I2C0, SPI0 and UART0 all pass on the soldered board |
| 🟢 **3.3 V rail** | **No separate regulator is needed.** Every load runs from the Pico's own `3V3(OUT)`, measured at **3.28–3.29 V through 45 back-to-back transmits** and 3.28–3.30 V at 100 % microSD write duty |
| 🟠 **Battery path** | **Switch and divider fitted; Schottky not.** Never connect USB while the battery is connected |
| 🟢 **Power LED** | **Fitted** — PWR-002. Whether the GP14 status LED was also fitted is not recorded |

## The design in one paragraph

A single 1S LiPo feeds a manual switch, a Schottky diode and then the Pico's `VSYS`. The
Pico's own regulator produces the **one and only 3.3 V rail**, and every peripheral — radio,
microSD, IMU, barometer, GPS and microphone — hangs off it. There is no second rail and no
external regulator: the AMS1117-3.3 was assessed and rejected, and the measurements then
showed that nothing needed replacing it. Three buses leave the Pico: I2C0 to the two
environmental sensors, SPI0 shared between the radio and the card, and UART0 to the GPS. Two
ADC channels read the battery divider and the microphone. Ground is a ring around the board
edge with the analogue ground tied to it exactly once.

**The one thing that surprised this project:** a long supply jumper made *every* microSD
write fail while every read passed, and the same fault made a healthy radio fail eight
transmits in a row ([F-10](../documentation/testing/bring-up-record.md#findings)). The bulk
and ceramic decoupling in the netlist is not decoration; it is the fix for a failure this
board actually had.

## The authoritative sources

Electrical facts live in four places, and they are ranked. When two disagree, the higher
one wins and the lower one is the bug.

1. **The hardware itself**, as recorded in
   [bring-up-record.md](../documentation/testing/bring-up-record.md). A measurement beats
   everything below it.
2. **`BoardPins`** in [`config.hpp`](../firmware/flight-computer/include/flight/config.hpp).
   The firmware decides which pin does what; a document that disagrees is wrong.
3. **[`schematics/vehicle-netlist.tsv`](schematics/vehicle-netlist.tsv)**, generated from 2
   and refusing to build if it disagrees with it.
4. **The prose and drawings** — [wiring.md](../documentation/design/wiring.md),
   [electrical-architecture.md](../documentation/design/electrical-architecture.md),
   [pico-gpio-map.md](../documentation/hardware/pico-gpio-map.md).

## Open items

| Item | Why it is open | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Schottky diode** between the switch and `VSYS` | **Not fitted at submission.** Required by the Pico datasheet §4.5 for a second supply; without it USB back-powers the LiPo | ~₹10 |
| ~~Manual ON/OFF switch~~ | **Fitted** (reported by the team, 2026-09-14). [PWR-001](../documentation/requirements/requirements.md) | — |
| ~~Power LED~~, lit the instant the switch closes | **Fitted** (reported by the team, 2026-09-14). PWR-002; PWR-003's immediate-on behaviour is not observed on record | — |
| **Status LED** on GP14 | **Not recorded** whether it was fitted. Not a requirement, but it is the only diagnostic visible on a sealed vehicle | — |
| ~~Battery divider~~, 33 kΩ / 33 kΩ into GP26 | **Fitted** (confirmed 2026-09-11); `battery_divider_ratio = 2.0` in the flight image. Row 2.6 never measured it | — |
| **Series current draw** | Four bench sessions have skipped it. The 3.3 V test link (`J1`) exists to make it a one-minute measurement | — |
| **Radio and card drawing together** | Each has been measured alone and the rail holds. Nothing has yet run both at once — that is bring-up gate 7 | — |
