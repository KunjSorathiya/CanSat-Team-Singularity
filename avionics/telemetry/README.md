# Telemetry

The radio link, the packet, and the onboard log.

**Status: 2026-10-02 — flown.** The link closed end to end on the bench on 2026-09-07, one range
test was made on 2026-09-10, and the max-rate pattern was measured at **3.11 Hz**
(bench record, 2026-09-14). **Update 2026-10-02:** it was then transmitted from a
descending vehicle. At the competition on 2026-09-30 the organizers' ground station received
**102 distinct packets** on sync word `0xA5` — a pad capture (2), Flight 1 (41, plus 41 after
the post-flight restart) and Flight 2 (18). Measured in flight: RSSI −109…−79 dBm (about 14 dB
better at the throw), **link margin at least 14 dB (mean 31 dB)** over the −123 dBm SF7
sensitivity, rate 3.09 Hz with the designed 374 + 296 + 296 ms gap pattern, packets at most
188 bytes (rich 136–188, lean 118–130) under the 200-byte ceiling. Flight 2 was still in the
1.43 Hz command window when thrown. Details: [`analysis/flight-2026-09-30/`](../../analysis/flight-2026-09-30/README.md)
and chapter 14 of the [final report](../../documentation/project/CanSat-2026-Final-Project-Report.pdf).

## The link

| | |
|---|---|
| Radio | SX1278 RA-02, 433 MHz, one on the vehicle and one on the ground bridge |
| Modem | SF7, 125 kHz, CR 4/5, 8-symbol preamble, payload CRC on |
| Power | 17 dBm on PA_BOOST — the RA-02's maximum without PA_DAC |
| Sync words | **`0xA5` on both ends** — the rulebook's official word, and the only one the organizers' station hears (`0xF3` is the rulebook's test word). The only radio parameters the rulebook fixes |
| Telemetry period | **700 ms — 1.43 Hz** for the five-minute command window, then the max-rate pattern — **3.11 Hz** — for the flight |
| Worst-case packet | **200 bytes** — the organizers' receiver discards anything longer. Every packet carries GPS and sound; the diagnostic tags are off the air |

Every one of those except the sync words is a project engineering choice, defined **once**
in [`link_profile.hpp`](../../firmware/common/include/cansat/link_profile.hpp) and used by
both ends of the link. Before that header existed the two ends carried separate copies and
agreed only by coincidence — a mismatch produces a silent, total link failure that looks
exactly like broken hardware.

**The header will not compile a profile that merely *meets* the rulebook's 1 Hz minimum.**
Three `static_assert`s enforce it: the packet must fit the FIFO, the worst-case airtime must
stay inside the 50 % duty cap, and the period must be at or below **`kMaxTelemetryPeriodMs`
= 950 ms** — the rulebook's 1000 ms less 50 ms of jitter margin. A period of exactly
1000 ms is refused, at compile time and again in `validate_config()` at startup.

**This vehicle cannot be built at 1 Hz.** If a live link reads 1 Hz, the cause is upstream of
the configuration — usually an image flashed before the period changed. The startup
summary prints the rate in Hz so that is one glance to confirm.

## What has been measured

From [bring-up-record.md](../../documentation/testing/bring-up-record.md), gates 5, 7 and 8.

| Quantity | Predicted | Measured | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Version register | `0x12` | `0x12`, re-read twice on the soldered board | ✅ |
| Airtime, 206-byte packet | 327.9 ms | **333.7 ms** | +1.8 % |
| Airtime, 255-byte packet | 399.6 ms | **406.9 ms** | +1.8 %, identical to 0.1 ms across four sessions |
| Sustained transmit | Every packet sent | **45 attempts in 15.0 s, 45 sent, 0 failed** | ✅ |
| End-to-end packets | Sequential from `P-001` | **66/66, no gaps, no duplicates** | ✅ |
| Packet loss, bench | 0 % | **0 % over 66 packets** | ✅ |
| RSSI, bench range | — | **−44 dBm** | — |
| Channel occupancy | ~33 % typical | **33.4 % typical, 40.7 % worst** | ✅ |

**The model reads 1.8 % low, consistently, on two boards.** That is not noise — it
reproduced to 0.1 ms across four sessions. The telemetry period is sized from the
**measured** airtime rather than the model because of it: 200 bytes costs ~323 ms once the
1.8 % is applied, so the 50 % duty cap puts the floor at ~647 ms, and 700 ms leaves the
real duty at 46 %.

## Why 700 ms and not 1000

The rulebook's 1 Hz is a **minimum**, and the 2026 revision scores rates above it. Two
changes took the vehicle from exactly the floor to 43 % above it:

1. **The packet carries only what is scored.** `GP-Lat`/`GP-Lon`/`GP-Alt` and the `SN-`
   sound level are on the air in every packet, because the organizers count only
   transmitted telemetry for extra-sensor points. The room came from the five diagnostic
   tags, which the rulebook does not reward: tags, GPS and sound together would not fit the
   FIFO. An earlier revision made the opposite trade — GPS to the log, on the reading that
   logging was enough — and the ruling reversed it.
2. **The period sized from measured airtime**, as above.

**What it cost was live mission state, and that has been won back.** With `MODE` and `ARM`
off the air the console showed mission state as unreported; since 2026-09-11 the nine-byte
`ST-` field carries state, armed, calibrated and the active fault count on every rich packet
it fits, and the full tags stay in the SD log. The position is back on the air, which is also what makes a vehicle that
lands out of sight findable from the ground station.

After the max-rate command the vehicle leaves 700 ms for a rich, lean, lean pattern — 3.11 Hz
with the sensors still at 1.04 Hz. See
[max-rate-command.md](../../documentation/design/max-rate-command.md).

**Sitting at exactly 1000 ms was its own hazard.** Any jitter puts an interval over a second
and the vehicle momentarily below a requirement that is *checked, not estimated*. 700 ms
carries 300 ms of margin — and since 2026-09-08 the hazard is not merely avoided but
**unreachable**: no build can carry a period above 950 ms.

## The packet

```text
CAN-Team-25; P-042; Ti-00:01:23:450; A-118.4; Pr-99821.33; T-24.6; Ro-2.1; Pi--1.4;
Ya-15.9; AX-0.12; AY--0.31; AZ-9.79; GP-Lat-21.16670; GP-Lon-72.78330; GP-Alt-131; SN-412.5;
```

Mandatory fields first, in the rulebook's order and to its exact precision, then optional
fields. Three independent parsers — C++, Python and JavaScript — are held to one fixture
file, [`protocol-fixtures.tsv`](../../test-data/protocol-fixtures.tsv), so they cannot
disagree.

**Two behaviours worth knowing:**

- **Wrong data is never transmitted.** If any mandatory field cannot be trusted, no packet
  is produced — and the packet number is **not consumed**. Transmitted numbers stay strictly
  sequential, so a gap at the ground station means radio loss and nothing else.
- **Optional fields shed before the packet overruns.** The controller drops the diagnostic
  tags, then `SN-`, then `GP-`, rather than let a packet pass the 200 bytes the organizers'
  station accepts.

## The onboard log

The card is the primary record; the radio is the live view.

- **No filesystem.** Records go into raw 512-byte blocks, with the header rewritten after
  every record, so a brownout or an impact reset resumes at the correct block instead of
  overwriting flight data.
- **It carries more than the packet does** — satellite count, HDOP, the microphone's clipping
  and gate columns, GPS at full precision, and GPS and sound for lean packets too.
- **It degrades quietly.** Ten consecutive write failures disable logging; telemetry is
  untouched.
- Measured: **2.677 ms mean write, 297–367 writes/s sustained**, 100/100 written across
  three sessions.

## Open items

| Item | Note |
|---|---|
| ~~**The official sync word `0xA5` has never been tried**~~ | **Closed 2026-09-30:** the organizers' station received the flight on `0xA5`. *As written 2026-09-14:* only `0xF3` has linked. Both Picos now fly `0xA5`, so the next bench run is its first try — and a run against the organizers' receiver code on an ESP32 is the test that matters |
| **Range** | *Flight 2026-09-30 was a terrace throw at about 30 m height; no long-range test is on record.* Every RSSI row past bench range was empty: 10 m, 100 m, 500 m, 1 km, and the range at which loss reaches 5 % |
| **Loss over 500 packets** | The bench run was 66 |
| **CRC errors on the USB link** | Row 8.3, never counted over a long run |
| **SD log against received telemetry** | Row 8.15. The card should be complete where the radio has gaps; nobody has diffed them |
| **The official dual ground stations** | The 2026 revision names the radios but not the framing or the host-side format — [open question 7](../../README.md) |
