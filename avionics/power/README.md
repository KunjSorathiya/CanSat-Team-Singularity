# Power

One battery, one rail, and one part that never made it in.

**Status: 2026-10-02 — flown.** *Update:* the vehicle flew on the LiPo through both competition
descents and a self-restart (≈ 2 s after the end of the Flight 1 record, consistent with the 2 s
watchdog) with no power fault recorded in the analysis, and it was powered by its switch (power at
the ground floor 18:14:34 for Flight 1, at the terrace 18:44:07 for Flight 2). No current or battery
life was measured. *As written 2026-09-14:* the rail is measured and holds under every load tried.
The **switch, the power LED and the battery divider are fitted**; the **Schottky diode is
not** (reported by the team, 2026-09-14). The consequence of that last one is operational, not electrical:
**never connect USB while the battery is connected.**

## The architecture, after it got simpler twice

```text
LiPo 1S  →  SW1  →  D1 (Schottky)  →  Pico VSYS  →  Pico 3V3(OUT)  →  everything
 3.7 V     switch    stops USB          pin 39         pin 36          one rail

```

**There is no external regulator, and none is needed.** That was not the plan. The design
spent weeks blocked on selecting one, because:

- the AMS1117-3.3 was assessed and **rejected** — a full cell at ≈4.2 V does not clear its
  high-load dropout, and its output sits below what the microSD reader's *listing* claimed
  to need;
- the microSD reader's supply was believed to be 4.5–5.5 V, which would have forced a boost
  stage.

**Both dissolved on inspection and measurement.** The delivered microSD board has no
regulator and no level shifter, its supply pin is printed `3V3`, and its entire parts list
is four 10 kΩ pull-ups and two capacitors — the listing described a different product
([D.1](../../documentation/hardware/receiving-inspection.md), [sd-module-analysis.md](../../documentation/hardware/sd-module-analysis.md)).
Then the Pico's own regulator was measured carrying every load without strain. One rail,
no boost, no external part.

## What has been measured

From [bring-up-record.md](../../documentation/testing/bring-up-record.md), gates 2, 5 and 6.

| Load | Rail voltage | Droop | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 45 back-to-back radio transmits, 15 s | **3.28–3.29 V** | 0.3 % | 45 sent, 0 failed |
| 100 % microSD write duty, 10 s | **3.28–3.30 V** | 0.6 % | 297–367 writes/s, far beyond anything the mission asks |

**The two together had not been run on the bench** *(2026-09-14)* — and they ran together in flight on 2026-09-30, transmitting and logging GPS and SD through both descents. The radio draws ~120 mA transmitting and the GPS
~67 mA, both from this same rail. Gate 7 is where that gets settled, and until it does this
gate stays amber rather than green: the individual questions are closed, the total is not.

## The battery end of the path

Five items. The two mandatory ones are in; the one that was never bought is not.

| Item | Requirement | Why it matters | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Manual ON/OFF switch** | [PWR-001](../../documentation/requirements/requirements.md), mandatory | The only way to turn the vehicle off, and so the only control behind radio silence during other teams' launches | **Fitted** (reported by the team, 2026-09-14) |
| **Power LED**, immediate | PWR-002, PWR-003, mandatory | **Red 5 mm on the regulated `+3V3` rail**, not a GPIO — a firmware-driven LED waits for boot and cannot be immediate. On `+3V3` rather than the switched battery node so brightness does not fade with the cell: [the indicator LEDs](../../documentation/design/electrical-architecture.md#the-indicator-leds). **1 kΩ gives it 1.3 mA, which is bench-bright and marginal outdoors** — 220–470 Ω is the better choice | **Fitted** (reported by the team, 2026-09-14). Resistor value and outdoor visibility not recorded |
| **Schottky diode**, 1 A | Pico datasheet §4.5 | Without it **USB back-powers the LiPo**. Never connect a USB cable while the battery is connected | **Not fitted at submission** |
| **Status LED** on GP14 | — | **Green 5 mm.** Its blink rate names the mission state, and bring-up rows 1.1–1.3 cannot be taken without it. **Measure its forward voltage first**: a 5 mm green is either ~2.0 V or ~3.1 V, and at 3.3 V through 1 kΩ that is the difference between 1.3 mA and 0.1 mA | **Not recorded** whether it was fitted before submission |
| **Battery divider**, 33 kΩ / 33 kΩ → GP26 | — | Lets the firmware report the cell voltage and raise `battery_low` below 3.5 V | **Fitted**, confirmed by the team 2026-09-11; the flight image sets `battery_divider_ratio = 2.0`. Bring-up row 2.6, the measurement, was never taken |

**Not a 1N4001.** A silicon diode drops 0.7 V for nothing here; the part is a `1N5817`,
`SS14` or `SS34`.

## The decoupling is not decoration

A long supply jumper made **every** microSD write fail while every read passed, and the same
fault on the RA-02's supply made a healthy radio fail eight transmits in a row
([F-10](../../documentation/testing/bring-up-record.md#findings)).

| Capacitor | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2 × 100 µF electrolytic | microSD `3V3`/`GND`, at the module's own pins | 200 µF against a ~50 µF requirement |
| 10 µF electrolytic | RA-02 `3.3V`/`GND` | PA key-up is 1.5 mA to 87 mA in microseconds |
| 3 × 0.1 µF ceramic (`104`) | microSD, RA-02, LM393 | Every bulk capacitor of every type is too slow for those edges |

The IMU, barometer and GPS are deliberately without a `104`
([D-8](../../documentation/hardware/assembly-procedure.md)). Electrolytics are polarised —
the stripe is the **negative** leg.

**A clean bench test does not mean the fault is absent.** F-10 was intermittent and
load-dependent: it appeared and vanished across five bench runs. The flight symptom is an
empty log or a radio that stops.

## Open items

| Item | Note |
|---|---|
| **Series current draw** | Four bench sessions have skipped it. The 3.3 V test link (`J1`) exists to make it a one-minute measurement |
| **Radio and card drawing simultaneously** | Gate 7. Each holds alone. *Update 2026-10-02:* the sum ran in flight, with telemetry throughout; the current was not measured |
| **Battery life** | Needs the series current above. No estimate should be quoted until then |
| **Write-transient current** | The rail *voltage* is measured under write load; the *current* is not |
| **Charging and protection** | [PWR-008](../../documentation/requirements/requirements.md). A balance charger is held; the procedure is not written |
| **Brownout and reset behaviour under load** | PWR-009 |

## Safety

- **Pico pin 40 is `VBUS`, live 5 V. Nothing on this board tolerates 5 V.** It is wired to
  nothing and must stay that way.
- **`AGND` (pin 33) is a separate plane.** Tie it to ground exactly once, beside pin 38.
- **Never connect USB while the battery is connected.** The Schottky was not fitted, so
  the switch alone does not protect the cell from being back-powered.
- Charge the LiPo on a non-flammable surface, attended.
