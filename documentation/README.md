# Documentation Index

Every engineering document for CanSat 2026, grouped by what you are trying to do.

> **Status: submitted 2026-09-14, flown 2026-09-30.** The CanSat and the first
> [final report](project/final-report.md) were handed in on 14 September. The vehicle then
> flew twice at the competition launch (thrown by hand from a ≈ 29.5 m terrace, not released
> from a drone), and the flight is reported in the
> [Final Project Report (PDF)](project/CanSat-2026-Final-Project-Report.pdf) and
> [`analysis/flight-2026-09-30/`](../analysis/flight-2026-09-30/). Documents written before
> 30 September describe the vehicle as submitted and carry a dated update note where the
> flight superseded them. Repository: <https://github.com/KunjSorathiya/CanSat-Team-Singularity>.

## Getting started

| Document | Contents |
|---|---|
| [quick-start.md](quick-start.md) | Zero to a working CanSat: PC setup, BOM, ordering, tools, wiring, assembly, SDK, flashing, subsystem bring-up, end-to-end test, fault injection, launch, recovery, troubleshooting, and time estimates for three experience levels |

---

## Requirements

| Document | Contents |
|---|---|
| [requirements.md](requirements/requirements.md) | Every extracted requirement with status and evidence, hardware gap analysis, nine development gates, and the open questions for the organizers |
| `updated CanSat Final Guidelines 2026.pdf` | **The current rulebook.** It resolves the dimension and altitude contradictions the original carried |
| `CanSat Final Guidelines.PDF` | The originally supplied rulebook, kept because several documents record what it contradicted |

## Mission

| Document | Contents |
|---|---|
| [concept-of-operations.md](mission/concept-of-operations.md) | The mission from power-on to recovery: the profile, phase by phase, the data budget, what is autonomous, failure behaviour, and what is still unknown. **It is also where [F-20](testing/bring-up-record.md#findings) was found** |

**Flight records.** The vehicle flew on 2026-09-30. The organizers' ground-station export, the
analysis scripts, the figures and `results.json` are in
[`analysis/flight-2026-09-30/`](../analysis/flight-2026-09-30/); the write-up is chapter 14 of
the [final report](project/CanSat-2026-Final-Project-Report.pdf). For a next flight, copy the SD
card and the ground-station logs first, then follow
[post-flight analysis](operations/runbook.md#post-flight-analysis).

## Generated artifacts

Nothing in this list should ever be hand-edited. Each is produced by a script, and the
script is what to change.

| Artifact | Generator |
|---|---|
| [`electrical/schematics/vehicle-netlist.tsv`](../electrical/schematics/vehicle-netlist.tsv) | [`tools/gen_netlist.py`](../tools/gen_netlist.py) — refuses to run if it disagrees with `flight::BoardPins` |
| [`hardware/diagrams/board-layout-to-scale.svg`](hardware/diagrams/board-layout-to-scale.svg) | [`tools/gen_board_layout.py`](../tools/gen_board_layout.py) |
| [`hardware/diagrams/wiring-schedule.svg`](hardware/diagrams/wiring-schedule.svg) | [`tools/gen_wiring_schedule.py`](../tools/gen_wiring_schedule.py) |

## Documentation rules

These rules apply to every document in this directory. They are the reason the
documentation is useful rather than optimistic.

1. **Evidence before claims.** A requirement is `Complete` only when this repository holds
   evidence. Owning a component is not integration; compiling code is not verification.
2. **Contradictions are surfaced, never resolved locally.** Where the rulebook conflicts
   with itself, both readings are recorded and the question is escalated. No value is
   invented to make a table look finished.
3. **Provisional values are labelled.** Anything the rulebook or the hardware has not fixed
   is marked `PROVISIONAL` or `TBD`, in documents and in code alike.
4. **Chip documentation is not board documentation.** A datasheet for the sensor die says
   nothing about the breakout's regulator, level shifters or pull-ups.
5. **Documentation and code must agree.** Pin maps, timing values and thresholds appear in
   both; when they diverge, the code is the truth and the document is the bug.
6. **A number a document states should be checked by something.**
   [`tools/check_doc_claims.py`](../tools/check_doc_claims.py) holds 307 documented claims to
   the source that defines them, and it runs in the same build as the tests. When a document
   states a figure that matters, add a check for it rather than trusting the next reader to
   notice.
7. **Where a figure can be generated, generate it.** A drawing whose dimensions were typed by
   hand is correct on the day it is drawn. See [Generated artifacts](#generated-artifacts).
