# Preliminary Raspberry Pi Pico GPIO Map

**Update 2026-10-02.** This document is a historical record and is kept as written. Since it was written the vehicle has been built and flown: at the competition launch on 30 September 2026 it made two descents, thrown by hand from a terrace at about 29.5 m (not lifted by a drone), under a 6 ft (1.83 m) parachute. The IMU, barometer, GPS (fixes in every rich packet), microphone, microSD log and LoRa link all worked in flight; the ground station received 102 distinct packets. Results: [flight analysis](../../analysis/flight-2026-09-30/) and chapter 14 of the [final report](../project/CanSat-2026-Final-Project-Report.pdf).

## Scope

This is the first preliminary GPIO-number assignment for the onboard Raspberry Pi Pico. It is a resource allocation for planning, not final wiring approval.

The map is based on the Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040 alternate-function model and the logical bus architecture in `pico-resource-map.md`. It remains subject to:

- Physical verification of every breakout board
- Electrical compatibility verification
- Power architecture approval
- Final firmware validation
- Final PCB and wiring review

No regulator is selected and no PCB or firmware is created here.

## Proposed Logical Architecture

| Bus or function | Preliminary allocation | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| I2C0 | GPIO4/GPIO5 | Matched I2C0 SDA/SCL alternate functions for the MPU-9250 and BMP280 |
| SPI0 | GPIO18/GPIO19/GPIO16 | Matched SPI0 SCK/TX/RX alternate functions for shared RA-02 and SD access |
| RA-02 CS/NSS | GPIO17 | Dedicated selection line; also supports SPI0 CSn alternate function |
| SD CS | GPIO6 | Separate ordinary GPIO selection line; not shared with RA-02 CS |
| UART0 | GPIO12/GPIO13 | Dedicated GPS UART TX/RX pair |
| RA-02 RESET | GPIO20 | Dedicated ordinary GPIO control line |
| RA-02 DIO0 | GPIO21 | Dedicated input/event line for radio interrupt handling |
| RA-02 DIO1 | GPIO22 | Optional dedicated radio event line; may be released if not needed |
| MPU-9250 INT | GPIO7 | Reserved interrupt-capable ordinary GPIO input |
| Status LED | GPIO14 | Dedicated ordinary GPIO; external LED polarity and resistor remain TBD |
| Battery ADC | GPIO26 / ADC0 | Reserved ADC-capable GPIO; divider is not designed |
| Microphone | GPIO27 / ADC1 | Analogue sound module `AO`, direct, no divider; additional sensor |

The alternate functions listed above must still be checked against the exact Pico datasheet revision and final board configuration. A valid Pico mux assignment does not prove that the connected breakout boards are electrically safe.

## Pico Documentation Basis

Source: [Raspberry Pi Pico datasheet](datasheets/raspberry_pi_pico_datasheet.pdf) and [official online copy](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf).

The selected pins use these documented RP2040 function roles:

- GPIO4/GPIO5: I2C0 SDA/SCL pair
- GPIO16/GPIO17/GPIO18/GPIO19: SPI0 RX/CSn/SCK/TX functions
- GPIO12/GPIO13: UART0 TX/RX pair
- GPIO26: ADC0
- GPIO27: ADC1
- GPIO6, GPIO7, GPIO14, GPIO20, GPIO21, and GPIO22: ordinary GPIO resources for control or input functions

The GPIOs used for control and interrupts do not need a special alternate function for this preliminary map. GPIO interrupt capability remains a firmware and final electrical validation item.

The Pico's onboard LED is not used as the competition-visible external LED. GPIO14 is reserved for a separate visible status/power LED so that its physical visibility can be designed into the CanSat structure.

## GPIO Reservation and Preliminary Assignment

| Pico GPIO | Function | Peripheral | Direction | Connected Device | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Connection Summary

```text
I2C:
GPIO4 -> SDA -> MPU-9250 + BMP280
GPIO5 -> SCL -> MPU-9250 + BMP280

SPI:
GPIO18 -> SCK  -> RA-02 + Micro SD
GPIO19 -> MOSI -> RA-02 + Micro SD
GPIO16 <- MISO <- RA-02 + Micro SD
GPIO17 -> CS/NSS -> RA-02
GPIO6  -> CS     -> Micro SD

UART:
GPIO12 -> TX -> GPS RX
GPIO13 <- RX <- GPS TX

RA-02:
GPIO20 -> RESET
GPIO21 <- DIO0
GPIO22 <- DIO1 (optional)

MPU-9250:
GPIO7 <- INT

LED:
GPIO14 -> status LED

Battery:
GPIO26 <- ADC reservation
GPIO27 <- sound module AO (additional sensor)
```

### LED Connection

The preliminary logical polarity is:

```text
GPIO14 -> current-limiting resistor - TBD -> external visible LED -> GND
```

An opposite-polarity arrangement remains possible if required by the selected hardware. The LED part, resistor value, current, power source, and immediate-on behavior must be verified separately. This GPIO assignment does not by itself satisfy the competition power-indicator requirement.

## ADC and Battery Monitoring

### Battery ADC Reservation

GPIO26/ADC0 carries the battery divider: **two 33 kΩ ±1 % parts in series across the pack, tapped at the midpoint**, giving a 2:1 ratio, 2.10 V at `GP26` on a full 4.20 V cell and 64 µA of continuous draw. The parts are in hand ([D.6](receiving-inspection.md#d6--the-resistors)) and metered; **the divider is the last analogue item to build**, at step 14 of the [assembly procedure](assembly-procedure.md). Until it is built and measured:

- No resistor divider is designed.
- No resistor values are selected.
- No protection circuit is selected.
- The LiPo must not be connected directly to GPIO26.
- Battery voltage range and Pico ADC limits must be checked before implementation.

## I2C Analysis and Design

The MPU-9250 and BMP280 share GPIO4/GPIO5 as one I2C0 bus.

| Device | Expected IC-level address | Address control | Map implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| MPU-9250 accelerometer + gyroscope | `0x68` or `0x69` | AD0 | No conflict with the other two |
| AK8963 magnetometer (second die in an MPU-9250) — **absent on the delivered MPU-6500** ([F-1](receiving-inspection.md#findings)) | `0x0C` | Fixed; visible only once `INT_PIN_CFG.BYPASS_EN` bridges it to the primary bus | No conflict with the other two |
| BMP280 | `0x76` or `0x77` | SDO | No conflict with the other two |

The address choices are IC-level documentation. The selected breakout's AD0/SDO wiring, pull-ups, voltage domain, and exposed interface remain unresolved.

- Both devices must operate at a compatible bus voltage.
- Pull-up implementation: **TBD / physical verification required.**
- No external pull-up values are selected.
- No hardware address modification is selected.
- If the actual boards expose conflicting or fixed behavior, the bus map must be revisited.

**I2C result:** The logical bus assignment is valid and has no documented address conflict. Electrical approval remains provisional.

## SPI Analysis and Design

The RA-02 and Micro SD reader share SPI0:

```text
GPIO18 -> SCK  -> RA-02 + Micro SD
GPIO19 -> MOSI -> RA-02 + Micro SD
GPIO16 <- MISO <- RA-02 + Micro SD
GPIO17 -> CS/NSS -> RA-02 only
GPIO6  -> CS     -> SD reader only
```

Only one CS should be asserted at a time. The non-selected device must release MISO or behave as documented for shared-bus operation.

The RA-02 additionally receives:

- GPIO20 -> RESET
- GPIO21 <- DIO0
- GPIO22 <- DIO1, optional

DIO0 is reserved because it is useful for receive-complete, transmit-complete, and other configured radio event handling. The exact event mapping depends on the final radio configuration and carrier-board availability.

The SD reader is a 3.3 V SPI board with no regulator and no level shifter, so its signals are 3.3 V like the Pico's and its supply comes from the same rail. Its header reads `GND MISO CLK MOSI CS 3V3` - note `CLK`, not `SCK`. What remains unresolved is its MISO release behaviour when deselected on the bus it shares with the RA-02, and its write-transient current. **GPIO assignment does not imply electrical approval.**

**SPI result:** Shared SPI with separate CS lines is logically valid and preserves the second SPI controller for future use. Electrical bus operation remains provisional.

## UART Design

The GPS connection is:

```text
GPIO12 / UART0 TX -> NEO-6M RX
GPIO13 / UART0 RX <- NEO-6M TX
```

The directions are intentionally not reversed. The exact NEO-6M breakout labels and logic levels remain subject to verification.

UART1 remains unassigned for debugging, a future sensor, or expansion if the final pin multiplexing permits. USB remains available for programming and development/debugging.

## Pico Resource Table

| Resource | Device/Function | Proposed allocation | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I2C0 | IMU, AK8963 (absent on the delivered part) and BMP280 | GPIO4 SDA / GPIO5 SCL | Provisional | Budgeted for three devices, two present; addresses are logically distinct; pull-ups and voltage TBD |
| SPI0 | RA-02 and Micro SD reader | GPIO18 SCK / GPIO19 MOSI / GPIO16 MISO | Provisional | Shared bus; separate CS lines; SD electrical behavior TBD |
| UART0 | NEO-6M GPS | GPIO12 TX / GPIO13 RX | Provisional | Pico TX -> GPS RX; Pico RX <- GPS TX |
| UART1 | Debug or future expansion | Unassigned | Reserved | Preserve if final pin multiplexing permits |
| ADC0 | Battery-voltage monitoring | GPIO26 | Reserved | Divider and protection not designed |
| ADC1 | Analogue microphone | GPIO27 | Assigned | Read as a burst of conversions per flight-loop tick and reduced to a peak-to-peak envelope; logged, never transmitted |
| GPIO | RA-02 controls, SD CS, MPU-9250 INT, status LED | GPIO17, GPIO6, GPIO20-GPIO22, GPIO7, GPIO14 | Provisional | Exact breakout pins and logic levels TBD |
| USB | Programming and development debug | USB interface | Preserved | Not consumed by mission peripherals |
| SWD/debug | Low-level development/debug | Pico debug interface | Preserved where practical | Access and header arrangement remain TBD |

## Debugging and Programming

- USB remains available for programming and development/debugging.
- UART1 is kept unassigned for a debug console, future sensor, or expansion if final pin multiplexing permits.
- SWD/debug access is preserved where practical through the Pico debug interface.
- GPIO0, GPIO1, GPIO2, GPIO3, GPIO8, GPIO9, GPIO10, GPIO11, GPIO15 and GPIO28 remain available for testing or expansion. **GPIO27 was one of them and is now the microphone.** A hall effect sensor, if its supply voltage is confirmed as 3.3 V, would take one of the digital pins above and needs no ADC channel.
- No debug resource is considered a mission connection until the final wiring review.

## Reserved and Spare Pins

### Reserved Resources

- GPIO17: RA-02 CS/NSS
- GPIO20: RA-02 RESET
- GPIO21: RA-02 DIO0
- GPIO22: optional RA-02 DIO1
- GPIO26/ADC0: battery monitoring reservation
- GPIO14: external visible status LED
- GPIO7: MPU-9250 INT reservation
- UART1-capable GPIO resources: preserved for debug or expansion
- USB: preserved for development and programming
- SWD/debug access: preserved where practical through the Pico debug interface

### Reserved / Spare Pins

The following exposed GPIOs are intentionally not assigned in this preliminary map:

| GPIO | Reason preserved |
|---:|---|
| GPIO0 | Future UART/SPI/I2C/GPIO expansion or test access |
| GPIO1 | Future UART/SPI/I2C/GPIO expansion or test access |
| GPIO2 | Future UART/SPI/I2C/GPIO expansion or test access |
| GPIO3 | Future UART/SPI/I2C/GPIO expansion or test access |
| GPIO8 | Preserve UART1/SPI1/I2C0-capable resource for debug or expansion |
| GPIO9 | Preserve UART1/SPI1/I2C0-capable resource for debug or expansion |
| GPIO10 | Preserve UART1/SPI1/I2C1-capable resource for debug or expansion |
| GPIO11 | Preserve UART1/SPI1/I2C1-capable resource for debug or expansion |
| GPIO15 | Spare ordinary GPIO and alternate-function resource |
| GPIO27 | Spare ADC-capable GPIO and expansion resource |
| GPIO28 | Spare ADC-capable GPIO and expansion resource |

GPIO25 is left for the Pico onboard LED function and is not used as the competition-visible external LED. SWD/debug pads and non-GPIO power/control pins are not treated as spare mission GPIOs.

## Resource Conflict Analysis

| Separate SPI chip selects | PASS | GPIO17 for RA-02 and GPIO6 for SD |
| I2C address sharing | PASS logically | IMU `0x68/0x69`; AK8963 `0x0C` (absent on the delivered part); BMP280 `0x76/0x77` |

| Debugging | PASS provisionally | USB and SWD/debug access preserved; UART1 unassigned |
| Electrical compatibility | NOT PASSED | Breakout supply, logic, pull-ups, MISO behavior, and pinouts remain unresolved |
| Power architecture | NOT PASSED | Regulator and complete load/transient budget remain unresolved |

## Provisional Power Relationship

This pin map does not design the power circuit. The eventual power architecture must consider the Pico, RA-02, MPU-9250, BMP280, NEO-6M, Micro SD reader, and status LED.

- The Pico supply input path remains subject to the electrical-compatibility review.
- The RA-02 and sensor breakout supply and logic levels remain subject to physical verification.
- The SD reader's `3V3` supply pin settles its supply, but not its behaviour on a shared SPI bus. **Nothing on the board buffers MISO**, so only the card releases it: confirm that release before trusting the reader beside the RA-02.
- No regulator, level shifter, resistor, capacitor, or power wiring is selected here.
- Power uncertainty can invalidate a physical connection, but it does not change the logical bus reservation by itself.

## Assignments That May Change

The following GPIO assignments may change after physical verification:

- GPIO17 if the RA-02 carrier does not expose the assumed CS/NSS function or requires a different control arrangement
- GPIO20 if RA-02 RESET is not exposed or has different electrical behavior
- GPIO21 and GPIO22 if the carrier does not expose DIO0/DIO1 or the selected radio mode needs different event lines
- GPIO6 if the SD reader CS label or host interface differs from the Robu listing
- GPIO16, GPIO18, and GPIO19 if the SD reader cannot share SPI electrically
- GPIO4 and GPIO5 if either sensor breakout does not expose I2C or its bus voltage/pull-ups are incompatible
- GPIO7 if the MPU-9250 breakout does not expose INT
- GPIO12 and GPIO13 if the GPS breakout uses different exposed pins or levels
- GPIO26 if battery monitoring is removed or a different ADC arrangement is required
- GPIO14 if the physical LED circuit requires a different control arrangement

These are hardware dependencies, not evidence of a logical Pico resource conflict.

## Dependencies Before Final GPIO Map

The following unresolved hardware questions can force a pin reassignment:

- RA-02 carrier pin availability and actual header pinout
- RA-02 RESET, DIO0, and optional DIO1 exposure
- SD module pin labels, CS behavior, and host-side logic-level implementation
- Whether the SD reader can share SPI electrically with the RA-02
- MPU-9250 breakout interface selection and INT availability
- BMP280 breakout interface selection and address/control pins
- GPS breakout TX/RX arrangement and any enable/reset controls
- Breakout-board logic levels and required level shifting
- Pico board variant and final pin-multiplexing constraints
- Whether battery monitoring is implemented and which ADC resource is suitable

The following uncertainties do not prevent this logical allocation, although they remain necessary for final wiring:

- Regulator selection
- Battery protection design
- Exact resistor and capacitor values
- RF connector type

## Engineering Decision

**GREEN, as of 2026-09-07 - the allocation is built, and every pin on it has been exercised on
hardware.** This section was YELLOW while the map depended on physical breakout verification and
electrical compatibility. Both are now done: the modules were identified from the delivered
boards rather than their listings, the vehicle board is soldered, and Gates 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 all
pass on it - I2C0 carrying `0x68` and `0x76` together, UART0 carrying clean NMEA, and SPI0
carrying the radio and the card at 4 MHz with zero misreads across 200 interleaved rounds.

Two assignments are wired but inert, and both say so where they are used: `GP22` (RA-02 `DIO1`)
and `GP7` (IMU `INT`) are configured as inputs and never read. `GP26` and `GP27` are assigned
but not yet built - the divider and the sound module are the last two things to fit.

The historical assessment follows, and is kept because it records what the map rested on before
hardware existed:

**YELLOW - The GPIO allocation is technically valid according to the Pico alternate-function model, but it depends on physical breakout verification and electrical compatibility.**

There is no identified GPIO or peripheral conflict in this preliminary map:

- I2C0 supports the MPU-9250 and BMP280 with distinct logical addresses.
- SPI0 supports shared RA-02 and SD signals with separate CS lines.
- UART0 supports the GPS with correct TX/RX directions.
- UART1, USB, SWD/debug, ADC capacity, and multiple GPIOs remain available.
- The proposed allocation does not require a regulator, level shifter, resistor, capacitor, or PCB decision.

The map must not be treated as final wiring approval.

## Final Question

**Can we now proceed to the actual Pico GPIO pin map?**

Yes, for this preliminary GPIO-number map. The final map remains subject to the dependencies above.

## Final Answers

1. **Is every required device assigned?** Yes, every listed mission device and control function has a preliminary logical GPIO or bus assignment. Electrical approval is still pending.
2. **Are any GPIOs conflicting?** No logical GPIO or alternate-function conflict was identified.
3. **How many GPIOs remain spare?** Eleven exposed GPIOs are intentionally listed as spare: GPIO0, GPIO1, GPIO2, GPIO3, GPIO8, GPIO9, GPIO10, GPIO11, GPIO15, GPIO27, and GPIO28. GPIO25 remains reserved for the Pico onboard LED and is not used for the external competition LED.
4. **Is the SPI sharing architecture valid?** Yes logically, with shared SCK/MOSI/MISO and separate RA-02 and SD CS lines. Electrical validation remains pending.
5. **Is the I2C sharing architecture valid?** Yes logically; MPU-9250 and BMP280 address options do not conflict. Pull-ups and bus voltage remain pending.
6. **Is the GPS UART allocation valid?** Yes; Pico TX is connected logically to GPS RX and Pico RX to GPS TX using UART0. Breakout labels and levels remain pending.
7. **Is battery ADC reserved?** Yes, GPIO26/ADC0 is reserved. No divider or direct battery connection is designed.
8. **Are debugging resources preserved?** Yes; USB, SWD/debug access, UART1 capacity, spare GPIO, and spare ADC-capable GPIOs are preserved.
9. **What physical checks could force reassignment?** RA-02 carrier pin availability, SD pin labels and level shifting, MPU-9250 INT exposure, GPS TX/RX arrangement, BMP280 interface selection, breakout logic levels, and Pico board/pin-mux verification.

This is a preliminary GPIO-number map only. No final wiring, regulator, PCB, firmware, or competition compliance claim is made.
