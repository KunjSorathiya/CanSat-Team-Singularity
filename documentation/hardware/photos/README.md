# Hardware Photographs

Photographs of the delivered boards. These are evidence, not illustration: every board-level
fact promoted from `TBD` in [hardware.md](../hardware.md) to a real value should be traceable
to a photograph here.

**Update 2026-10-02.** Two photographs of the finished hardware now exist, copied from the final report's figures
(`documentation/project/report-2026/figures/photos/`): `cansat-assembled.jpg`, the assembled vehicle, and `pcb-top.jpg`, the vehicle board seen from
the component side. The vehicle flew on 30 September 2026. They are listed at the end of the index below; the 2026-09-04 delivery photographs are unchanged.

| `lm393-sound-front.jpg` | LM393 sound module | **Four-pin header `AO DO GND VCC`** — the fact that decides whether the analogue channel exists at all. `LM393` `49M` `BWQ64` SOIC, cermet gain trimpot, electret capsule with `+`/`−` pad marks, `PWR-LED` and `DO-LED` indicators, SMD resistors marked `102` and `201`. Transcribed in [receiving-inspection.md](../receiving-inspection.md) D.5 |
| `passives-2026-09-06.jpg` | Second-batch passives | The capacitors (`10µF 50V`, `100µF 50V`, `100µF 25V`, ceramic `104` discs) and the three resistor groups in one frame. **A layout for identification, not a count** — the delivered quantities are as ordered. Values come from the close-ups below |
| `capacitors-2026-09-06.jpg` | The capacitors | **`10µF 50V`, `100µF 50V`, `100µF 25V`** read off the sleeves, and one ceramic disc whose print is worn illegible. **One of each, laid out to be identified — not a count** — see [D.7](../receiving-inspection.md#d7--the-capacitors) |
| `resistors-100k-5pct.jpg` | Resistor group 1 | **100 kΩ ±5 %.** Carbon film, beige body, four bands: brown‑black‑yellow‑gold |
| `resistors-33k-1pct.jpg` | Resistor group 2 | **33 kΩ ±1 %.** Metal film, blue body, five bands: orange‑orange‑black‑red‑brown |
| `resistors-1k-5pct.jpg` | Resistor group 3 | **1 kΩ ±5 %.** Mint body, four bands: brown‑black‑red‑gold |
| `cansat-assembled.jpg` | The assembled vehicle (added 2026-10-02) | The finished build as flown, with the rocker switch on short leads outside the frame |
| `pcb-top.jpg` | The vehicle board, component side (added 2026-10-02) | The built board with the power LED fitted |

Outstanding re-shoots, all macro:

- ~~The **resistor colour bands**.~~ Settled 2026-09-06 by the three close-ups above. **They should still be metered before fitting** — a photograph proves what is printed on a part, never what the part does.

- Both RF **mating faces**, straight on — the only way to settle SMA against RP-SMA.
- ~~The **BMP280 die**, to settle BMP280 against BME280.~~ Settled by register instead on 2026-09-05: chip ID `0xD0` returned `0x58` ([F-4](../receiving-inspection.md#findings)). A photograph is no longer needed for this.
- The **MPU-9250, NEO-6M and microSD regulator markings** — all SOT-23 parts whose text is
  below these photographs' resolution.

## Naming

Examples:

11566-sd-reader-regulator.jpg
1121334-antenna-connector.jpg
1125094-lipo-label.jpg
```

Views: `front`, `back`, plus a descriptive word for close-ups — `regulator`,
`level-shifter`, `header-labels`, `connector`, `label`, `strap`.

## What makes a photograph useful

- Part markings legible at full zoom. If the regulator's marking cannot be read, the photo
  has recorded nothing.
- Even light, no flash glare across the silkscreen.
- Something for scale in at least one shot per board.
- Straight-on for connectors — the centre contact is what distinguishes SMA from RP-SMA.
