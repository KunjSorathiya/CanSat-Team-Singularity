# Hardware Bring-Up Record

Every number this repository computes but has never observed, paired with how to measure it
and space to write down what you actually got.

**Print it, or fill it in as you go.** The point is not paperwork: this project has made a
long series of predictions — airtime, output rates, bus loads, link margin — from datasheets
and arithmetic. Each one is a place where reality can differ, and the difference is worth
knowing *before* it appears as a lost flight. A prediction that survives measurement becomes
a fact. One that does not is a finding.

**Fill in:** the measured value, the date, and who took it. Leave a row blank rather than
guessing — a blank row is honest, a guessed one is worse than nothing.

## How to use this

Work the gates in order. Each is a stop: if a row fails, fix it before moving on, because a
fault on a shared bus is far harder to find with three devices on it than with one.

| # | Quantity | Predicted | Predicted Hz | How to measure | Measured | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Status LED blink, `READY` unarmed | 900 ms on, 900 ms off — **1800 ms full cycle** | **0.56 Hz** | Stopwatch over 10 **full cycles**, divide by 10; or the meter's `Hz` range on GP14 | | |
| 1.2 | Status LED blink, `READY` armed | 400 ms on, 400 ms off — **800 ms full cycle** | **1.25 Hz** | Same, after the arming delay | | |
| 1.3 | Status LED blink, `FLIGHT` | 100 ms on, 100 ms off — **200 ms full cycle** | **5 Hz** | Same | | |
| 1.3a | Status LED blink, `LANDED` / `RECOVERY` | 250 ms on, 250 ms off — **500 ms full cycle** | **2 Hz** | Same, after a landing is declared | | |
| 1.3b | Status LED blink, `FAULT` | 60 ms on, 60 ms off — **120 ms full cycle** | **8.3 Hz** | Same, with a mandatory sensor disconnected so the state machine latches `FAULT` | | |
| 1.4 | USB serial enumerates | Appears as a serial port | — | Device manager / `ls /dev/tty*` | **Yes.** Both Picos enumerate; the ground bridge came up as `COM4`, and the port appears and disappears with the cable | ✅ 2026-09-05 / KS |
| 1.5 | Boot to first telemetry attempt | < 1 s | — | Log timestamps from power-on | **Deferred — not measurable at this gate.** See the note below | — |
| 1.6 | Bridge status cadence, no radio attached | 1000 ms (`STATUS_PERIOD_MS`) | 1 Hz | Watch the `#state=RX` line in a serial monitor | **1 Hz, steady, no gaps** over a continuous run | ✅ 2026-09-05 / KS |
| 1.7 | USB frame integrity | Length and CRC-16/CCITT match the payload | — | Decode one captured frame by hand against `frame_encode()` | **Byte-exact.** `$51,56b5,` against a 51-character payload whose CRC independently computes to `56b5` | ✅ 2026-09-05 / KS |

> **Read the predicted numbers carefully — they are half-periods, not blink rates.**
> `update_led()` computes `on = (mission_ms / period) % 2 == 0`, so `period` is the time the
> LED spends **on**, and the same again **off**. A "900 ms" state therefore blinks once every

## Gate 2 · Power

🔴 **This gate is blocked on one thing: no regulator is selected.** See
[electrical-architecture.md](../design/electrical-architecture.md). Complete it before any
battery-powered test.

> **The microSD reader's supply is no longer part of this blocker.** Receiving inspection
> [D.1](../hardware/receiving-inspection.md#d1--the-microsd-reader-sku-11566) closed it on
> 2026-09-04: the delivered board has **no regulator and no level shifter**, its supply pin is
> printed `3V3`, and its entire parts list is four 10 kΩ pull-ups and two capacitors. The
> supplier listing that described a 4.5–5.5 V board described a different product from the one
> that arrived — see [sd-module-analysis.md](../hardware/sd-module-analysis.md) for why this
> question held up the power design for so long.
>
> **The consequence simplifies this gate.** There is one 3.3 V rail, not two, and the boost
> stage the earlier design reserved is not to be built.
>
> **The microSD half is now answered, on 2026-09-05.** Under a 10-second sustained write at
> 100 % duty — 324 writes per second, far beyond anything the mission asks — the 3V3 rail held
> **3.28–3.30 V**. That is a 0.6 % droop. **The Pico's own regulator carries the card without
> strain, and the peripherals do not need a rail of their own on the card's account.**
>
> **What is still open is the combined case.** The radio draws ~120 mA transmitting and the
> GPS ~67 mA, both from this same rail, and nothing has yet run them together. Gate 7 is where
> that is settled. Until then this gate stays amber rather than green: the SD question is
> closed, the total is not.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Regulator output, no load | — (part not chosen) | Multimeter at the rail | | |
| 2.2 | Regulator output, radio transmitting | — | Scope on the rail during a TX burst | | |
| 2.3 | Rail droop during TX | Must not brown out the Pico | Scope, minimum during TX | | |
| 2.4 | Idle current | — | Inline meter, vehicle in `READY` | | |
| 2.5 | Peak current during TX | — | Inline meter or scope across a shunt | | |
| 2.6 | Battery voltage at the ADC pin | **2.10 V at `GP26` for a 4.20 V cell** — a 33 kΩ/33 kΩ 1 % divider, ratio 2.0 | Multimeter at GP26 and at the battery, together. Set `battery_divider_ratio = 2.0` only once both legs are fitted and this row is taken — until then the firmware reports raw pin volts and says so | | |
| 2.7 | Endurance, full charge to cutoff | — | Log until telemetry stops | | |

**Until 2.6 is measured and `battery_divider_ratio` set, battery telemetry is the raw ADC
pin voltage — not the cell voltage.** That is deliberate: an invented ratio would produce a
confident wrong number.

## Gate 3 · Sensors

| # | Quantity | Predicted | Source | How to measure | Measured | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.0 | **Address sanity, if a sensor ever "fails"** | Scan finds `0x68` and `0x76` | Read the scan and the driver-init lines together | **Diagnostic signature, not a measurement.** The scan probes `0x68`/`0x69` and `0x76`/`0x77`, but both drivers use one fixed address — `Mpu9250::Options::address = 0x68`, `Bmp280::Options::address = 0x76`. So **a scan reporting `0x69` or `0x77` while the matching driver reports FAILED means that part's strap pin has been pulled high**, not that the sensor or the bus is broken. `AD0` high moves the IMU to `0x69`; `SDO` high moves the barometer to `0x77` | — |
| 3.1 | I2C devices found | 2 before IMU init (0x68, 0x76). A nine-axis part adds `0x0C` after init; **the delivered six-axis part does not**, and the diagnostic now says so rather than asking for it | [wiring.md](../design/wiring.md) | Bus scan — `cansat_bringup_firmware` scans twice | **Both parts answer, tested one at a time: `0x68` and `0x76`**, matching the firmware defaults — so AD0 and SDO are both strapped low. **`0x0C` never appears**, in either scan, with or without the bypass: there is no magnetometer, see 8.8. **Both on the bus together on the soldered board, 2026-09-07: `0x68` and `0x76` answered in the same scan, and again in the post-init scan — `0x0C` absent from both.** That was the open half of this row and it is now closed | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS — both parts share I2C0 correctly, and `0x0C` is a real absence |
| 3.2 | Stationary acceleration magnitude | 9.81 m/s². **Firmware gate is ±1.5** (`calib_accel_tol_mps2`); a healthy part at rest should be an order of magnitude tighter | `calib_accel_tol_mps2` | Read 100 samples, take the mean | **9.8675 m/s², sd 0.0092**, 100 of 100 samples valid. **Second session, soldered board 2026-09-07: 9.7737 m/s², sd 0.0205**, 100 of 100. The two bracket a plausible local g and differ by ~1 %, which is scale and temperature, not a fault — the board sat at a die temperature of 35.6 °C for the second | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS |
| 3.3 | Stationary gyro bias, per axis | Within ±25 dps, typically < 5 | `calib_max_gyro_bias_dps` | Mean of 100 still samples | **X −3.3878, Y +0.9079, Z −0.4720 dps.** All inside ±25, and inside the datasheet's ±5 zero-rate figure. Startup calibration removes these.<br><br>**Soldered board 2026-09-07: X −3.2994, Y +0.8628, Z −0.0628 dps.** X and Y repeat to within 0.09 and 0.05 dps. **Z moved by 0.41 dps between sessions** — see [F-13](#findings), because that number is the vehicle's yaw budget, not a curiosity | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS |
| 3.4 | Gyro noise, per axis | < 2 dps standard deviation | `calib_gyro_still_dps` | Standard deviation of the same samples | **X 0.0984, Y 0.0964, Z 0.1424 dps sd.** Fourteen to twenty times inside the limit — a quiet part. **Soldered board 2026-09-07: X 0.1473, Y 0.1078, Z 0.0468.** Same order, and no worse beside a transmitting radio | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS |
| 3.5 | Barometer output rate | **83 Hz** typical, 72 Hz worst case | [sensor-rates.md](../design/sensor-rates.md) | Count falling edges of `STATUS.measuring` (0xF3 bit 3); **not** changed values — see the note | **83.0 Hz.** 166 `STATUS.measuring` falling edges in 2 s, status polled at 9.1 kHz so no completion could be missed. Changed-value counting gave 46.5 Hz on the same run — the undercount described below | ✅ 2026-09-05 / KS — matches the 83.3 Hz prediction, 2.8× margin over 30 Hz confirmed |
| 3.6 | Pressure vs a local reference | Within a few hundred Pa | — | Compare with a weather station or second barometer | | |
| 3.7 | Achieved acquisition rate | **30 Hz** (33 ms period) | `sensor_period_ms` | Log mission time between sensor ticks | **33.289 ms mean → 30.04 Hz**, over 150 ticks. **Soldered board 2026-09-07, with both sensors on the bus: 33.772 ms → 29.61 Hz.** 0.77 ms slow, 2.3 % — loop overhead, and inside tolerance | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS |
| 3.8 | Acquisition jitter | < 6 % of the period (2 ms) | 2 ms loop tick | Standard deviation of the same intervals | **0.453 ms sd** against a 1.98 ms limit — 4.4× inside. Sensor read cost **0.282 ms mean, 0.33–0.35 ms worst across two runs**, i.e. under 1 % of the period (barometer only; the IMU was not wired for this run).<br><br>**Re-taken with both sensors on the bus, 2026-09-07: 0.420 ms sd, and a sensor read of 0.763 ms mean / 0.833 ms worst.** Adding the IMU roughly trebled the read cost, as it should — **and it is still 2.5 % of the 33 ms period.** This is the honest figure; the earlier one measured half the sensors | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS |
| 3.9 | Calibration settle time | Within `calib_samples` at 30 Hz ≈ 2.7 s | `startup_calibration.cpp` | Time from power-on to `CAL-1` in telemetry | | |
| 3.15 | **Flight firmware startup summary** | Every fitted subsystem reported, and its state | Flash `cansat_pico_firmware`, open a serial monitor, wait ~1.2 s | **Added 2026-09-07.** Prints IMU, barometer, GPS, radio, SD and sound with OK/FAILED, plus `state`, active fault count, armed and calibrated. Repeats every 3 s while unarmed so a monitor attached after the port re-enumerates still catches it, and stops permanently once armed. **It reports whether the microphone answered; it does not log its values** — see [F-15](#findings) | |
| 3.14 | **IMU `INT` asserts on new data** | A transition per sample at the configured rate | Poll `GP7` while the IMU is running | **Not takeable yet, and the reason is firmware, not wiring.** The pin is connected as of 2026-09-07. `mpu9250.cpp` writes `INT_PIN_CFG = 0x02` (`BYPASS_EN` only) and never writes `INT_ENABLE`, so no interrupt source is enabled and the pin stays static. **Its value when enabled is diagnostic separation** — it says the IMU is *producing samples* independently of whether I2C reads succeed, which is the exact question [F-5](#findings), [F-6](#findings) and [F-12](#findings) each cost a bench session to answer | — |
| 3.10 | I2C bus utilisation | ~1.6 % at 30 Hz | [sensor-rates.md](../design/sensor-rates.md) | Scope SCL, measure active time per second | | |
| 3.11 | **Microphone quiet-room floor** | A small non-zero span, **not** zero and **not** clipped; `sound_gate_pct` near 0 | `sound_mv_pp` and `sound_gate_pct` in the SD log, vehicle still, room quiet. **A span of exactly zero means `AO` is not connected**, and a span that never moves means it is not connected to a microphone | | |
| 3.12 | **Microphone responds to sound** | Both channels move: the level rises clearly above 3.11 and returns, and `sound_gate_pct` rises from near 0 | Clap, then speak steadily. **A clap should give a high level at low duty and speech a lower level at higher duty** — that difference is the whole reason both channels are carried | | |
| 3.13a | **Board variant recorded** | 3-pin or 4-pin, written down | Count the pins. A 3-pin board has no `AO` at all and needs `sound_analog_connected = false`, or the log fills with a floating ADC pin that looks exactly like a quiet room | **Four-pin: `AO DO GND VCC`**, read off the header silkscreen in the delivery photograph ([D.5](../hardware/receiving-inspection.md#d5--the-lm393-sound-module)). Both channels are real; both config flags are correct at their defaults | ✅ 2026-09-06 / KS |
| 3.13 | **Trimpot position recorded** | A written record exists | The gain is set by an unmarked trimpot and nothing reads it back, so **two flights at different positions produce incomparable numbers.** Set it, mark it, write it down | | |

> **3.5 was re-taken, and the first attempt's shortfall was the method, not the sensor.** The
> first measurement counted *changed* pressure values and got 44 Hz against a predicted 83.
> The edge-counting method on the same board returns **83.0 Hz**. That undercount happens

| 4.1 | Raw NMEA arrives | Sentences at 9600 baud | Serial monitor on the UART | **Yes.** `$GPRMC`, `$GPVTG`, `$GPGGA`, `$GPGSA`, `$GPGSV`, `$GPGLL` — one full cycle per second, well formed, at 9600 baud. **818 bytes in 5 s (164 B/s)** against the 960 B/s the line carries. **Repeated on the soldered board 2026-09-07: 810 bytes in 5 s, same six sentences, 0 checksum errors**, with the radio and the card on the same board | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS |
| 4.2 | Time to first fix, cold, outdoors | Minutes | Stopwatch from power-on to `GP-Lat` appearing | Not yet taken — needs sky. **Indoors it reached one satellite in view within 5 s** (`$GPGSV,1,1,01,04,,,28`: PRN 04 at 28 dB-Hz), so the receiver and antenna path are live | |

| 4.5 | Fix held while the radio transmits | No dropouts | Watch the fix flag through 50 transmissions | | |

## Gate 5 · Radio

**The most valuable gate in this document.** Everything about the telemetry rate rested on
computed airtime that had never been observed. **It has now been observed four times, on two
boards, and agrees to within 1.8 % every time.**

> and 5.3 passed on the first attempt — `0x12`, 5/5 at 206 bytes, 5/5 at 255 bytes — and 5.4a
> ran 45 of 45 with an unbroken line of dots. Fifty-five transmits, no failures.
>
> **The breadboard could never have told us this.** [F-5](#findings) is the same 206-byte

## Gate 7 · Shared bus

The radio and the microSD share SPI0. This gate exists because they have never been on a
bus together.

| # | Quantity | Predicted | How to measure | Measured | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | Radio works with the card present but idle | No change from Gate 5 | Repeat 5.1 and 5.4 | **Version `0x12`, unchanged**, re-read over the bus after the card had initialised. **Repeated on the soldered board 2026-09-07** | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS |
| 7.2 | Card works with the radio present but idle | No change from Gate 6 | Repeat 6.1 and 6.3 | **Card initialised with the radio on the bus**, 42 ms in ACMD41, 2 CMD0 attempts. **Soldered board 2026-09-07: initialised again with the radio present** | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS |
| 7.3 | Radio works *during* card writes | No lost packets | Run both at full rate for 5 minutes | **30 transmit-then-write rounds: 0 transmit failures, 0 write failures, 0 radio misreads.** Each round is a 206-byte transmit, then a block write, then a radio version read — the interleaving the flight loop actually does. Ten seconds, not five minutes. **Passed three times now, on separate power cycles and on both boards** — the soldered board repeated 30/30 clean on 2026-09-07. The five-minute duration this row asks for has still never been run | ⚠️ 2026-09-07 / KS — passes every time it is run; the duration is owed |
| 7.4 | MISO released when each device is deselected | Line goes high-impedance | Scope MISO during the other device's transaction | **200 interleaved rounds: 0 card-read failures, 0 radio misreads.** Every radio probe returned `0x12`. Measured rather than scoped — a held MISO would have corrupted the radio read. **Repeated on the soldered board 2026-09-07: 200 rounds, 0 and 0** | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS |
| 7.5 | SPI clock after an SD transfer | 4 MHz, unchanged for the radio | Scope SCK during a radio transaction | **Radio reads correctly at the 4 MHz the SD driver raises the bus to.** Confirmed by the same version re-read as 7.1, and again on the soldered board 2026-09-07 | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS |

> **Phase A passed on 2026-09-05, and it is the half that matters most.** 200 interleaved
> rounds with zero card-read failures and zero radio misreads: **the card releases MISO and

> all.
>
> **7.5 came free with 7.1.** The SD driver raises SPI from 400 kHz to 4 MHz once the card is
> up, and the radio then answered correctly at that clock. Two rows from one register read.
>
> **The highest-risk integration in the BOM is now the one with the most evidence behind it.**
> 7.3 is still open and needs an antenna.

> **`cansat_bringup_firmware` takes this gate in two phases**, because half of it is free

>
> **Phase A is non-destructive and needs no antenna.** It initialises both devices, then

> 4 MHz — that single read covers 7.1 and 7.5 together. It then runs **200 rounds of

> probe precisely because its correct answer is known in advance: `0x12` or the bus is
> lying. Any other value is unambiguous corruption rather than a judgement call, and that is
> 7.4 measured rather than scoped.
>
> **Phase B is prompted separately**, because it transmits and it overwrites the log: 30

> 7.3.
>
> The three counters are reported separately — card failures, radio misreads, transmit
> failures — because they point at different faults and a single pass/fail would lose that.

| # | Quantity | Predicted | How to measure | Measured | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | Packet numbering | Sequential from `P-001`, no gaps | Ground-station validator over 500 packets | **66/66 sequential from `P-001`, no gaps, no duplicates** — but the row asks for 500 and this was 66. Partial | |
| 8.2 | Ground-station packet loss, bench | 0 % | Loss counter | **0 % over 66 packets.** The bridge's own `frames` counter incremented exactly one per packet with `dropped=0` throughout, so nothing was lost on the radio *or* between the radio and USB. 66 is not the 500 of 8.1; partial for the same reason | |
| 8.3 | CRC errors on the USB link | 0 | Link health panel | | |
| 8.4 | Mission clock vs wall clock | Within 1 % | Compare `Ti-` with a stopwatch over 10 minutes | | |
| 8.5 | Altitude at rest | ≈ 0.0 m after calibration | Read `A-` on the bench | **−0.5 m to +0.1 m across 62 stationary packets**, after `CAL-1` at P-005. Before calibration the same bench read `A-23.0` — the reference pressure being replaced by the measured one, which is the mechanism working | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS |
| 8.6 | Altitude vs a known height | Within a few metres | Carry the vehicle up a measured staircase | | |
| 8.7 | Attitude vs a known orientation | Within a few degrees | Place on a level surface, then on each face | | |
| 8.8 | `WHO_AM_I` of the IMU | `0x71` or `0x73` | Read at initialisation; the health report carries it | **`0x70` — an MPU-6500.** Not the nine-axis part the module was sold as. Read with `cansat_bringup_firmware` | ❌ 2026-09-05 / KS — see [F-1](../hardware/receiving-inspection.md#findings) |
| 8.9 | Magnetometer present and answering | AK8963 found at `0x0C`, `mag_ok` true | Health snapshot | **Absent.** `0x0C` does not appear in the bus scan taken *after* `BYPASS_EN` is set — there is nothing behind the bridge | ❌ 2026-09-05 / KS |
| 8.10 | Total magnetic field, vehicle assembled | 25–65 µT, and stable as the vehicle is moved | `mag_field_ut` in the health snapshot | **Not takeable on this part** — no magnetometer. 0 of 100 samples carried one | N/A |
| 8.11 | Magnetometer calibration sweep | Every axis spans ≥ 30 µT; calibration accepted | Figure-of-eight with `mag_cal_in_flight` set; watch `mag_cal_span_ut` | **Not takeable on this part** | N/A |
| 8.12 | Yaw drift, stationary, 10 minutes, uncalibrated | Drifts: no magnetic reference is being applied | Record `Ya-` with `YR-G` in the packets | **Taken from a 36.8-minute stationary SD log, 2209 records.** **Yaw made more than a full revolution while the vehicle sat still**: unwrapped −16.9° to **+362.8°**, ending +79.0°. But it did not drift steadily — **the first 15 minutes were nearly perfect, ±0.8° total at 0.002 dps**, and drift then switched on to ±0.39 dps. See [F-17](#findings) | ✅ 2026-09-07 / KS |
| 8.13 | Yaw drift, stationary, 10 minutes, calibrated | Holds: bounded by magnetometer noise, not integrating | Record `Ya-` with `YR-M` in the packets | **Not takeable on this part.** `YR-M` will never appear in this vehicle's telemetry | N/A |
| 8.14 | Yaw against a known bearing | Within a few degrees of a hand compass, four cardinal directions | Point the vehicle, read `Ya-`/heading | **Not takeable on this part** — there is no absolute heading to compare | N/A |
| 8.16 | **Normal flight carries the sensors** | Every packet at 1.43 Hz carries `GP-` (once there is a fix) and `SN-`, and none carries `MODE`/`FAULTS`/`CAL`/`ARM`/`YR` | Watch the console's raw monitor for a minute after power-on and read three consecutive packets | | |
| 8.17 | **`MAX_RATE` on the air** | ~3.13 Hz at the station; every third packet carries `GP-` and `SN-` and the two between carry neither; a second press does nothing; a power cycle restores 1.43 Hz | Send it from the console within the five-minute command window, measure the station's rate over two minutes and read six consecutive raw packets. The vehicle's startup summary must read `rate COMMANDED MAX` and `commands accepted 1` | **3.11 Hz** at the station over 3 min 26 s. The summary read `commands accepted 1, refused 0`, `uplink CLOSED` and `rate COMMANDED MAX` in every block, with no reset. 2026-09-11, on a build with the arming delay held off by hand — before the command window existed, and the pattern and latch are unchanged by it | **PARTIAL** — rate and latch pass. The rich/lean pattern in the raw packets, a second press and the power-cycle restore were not checked |
| 8.18 | **Loss at the commanded rate** | No gaps in packet numbering over two minutes at 3.13 Hz | The rulebook scores rate and packet loss on the same five points, so a rate that costs packets is not a gain. Count gaps in the station's packet numbers | **1 of 544** missing (0.2 %) over 3 min 26 s at 3.11 Hz; RSSI −21 dBm, SNR 10.0 dB at bench range | **FAIL** by its own criterion — one gap. 0.2 % at bench range says nothing yet about the field |
| 8.15 | SD log vs received telemetry | SD complete, radio may have gaps | Diff the two after a run | | |

## Findings

Anything that did not match its prediction. One line each: what was expected, what was
measured, what you did about it.

| # | Gate | Expected | Measured | Action taken |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 · 8 | An MPU-9250: `WHO_AM_I` `0x71`/`0x73`, and an AK8963 answering at `0x0C` once `BYPASS_EN` is set | **`WHO_AM_I` `0x70` — an MPU-6500. Six axes, no magnetometer.** `0x0C` never appears, in either scan, with or without the bypass | Recorded as [F-1](../hardware/receiving-inspection.md#findings). The firmware accepts `0x70` as a six-axis part rather than refusing to boot, and the estimator degrades instead of stopping. **The vehicle has no absolute yaw reference:** yaw is gyro-integrated and drifts, and telemetry reports `YR-G`, never `YR-M`. Rows 8.9–8.11, 8.13 and 8.14 are not takeable on this part |
| 2 | 3 | Barometer output rate ≈ 83 Hz | The first procedure counted *changed values* and reported 44 Hz, then 46.5 Hz on a re-run — a 2× undercount, not a slow part | The procedure was the defect, not the sensor. Row 3.5 now counts falling edges of `STATUS.measuring` and reads **83.0 Hz**, matching the 83.3 Hz prediction with 2.8× margin over the 30 Hz acquisition rate |
| 3 | — | A working multimeter | The resistance range read ~51 Ω between *every* pair of pins, including two with no path between them, and 18 Ω across its own shorted probe tips | **None of those numbers were recorded as measurements.** They describe the instrument, and it is written up in the Part A tools table instead. `C.3.6`/`C.3.7` and `C.4.5`/`C.4.6` stay blank until a working resistance range is available; the Gate 3 bus scan answers the same question from the address each device actually replies at |
| 4 | 4 | GPS NMEA checksum errors ≈ 0 | **0** over an 18 s indoor run, without a fix | Accepted as provisional (row 4.3, ⚠️). Sentences without a fix carry empty fields and are shorter than the ones that matter; the row is to be re-taken with a fix before it counts |
| 5 | 5 | A radio that either works or does not | **The same 206-byte transmit failed 5/5 in row 5.2 and then succeeded 45/45 in row 5.4a, minutes later on one power cycle** — same code, same length, same antenna. The previous power cycle had passed 5.2 and 5.3 outright. At the failures `IRQ_FLAGS = 0x00`: `TxDone` was never set, so the packets did not merely go unreported, they did not complete | **Closed by [F-10](#findings): the RA-02's 3V3 jumper.** Shortening it, exactly as the microSD's had been, gave 5/5 and 5/5 on rows 5.2 and 5.3 and a clean Gate 7. The same fault on the same kind of wire on both modules — a supply that carries an idle part and not a working one. The `RegOpMode`/`RegVersion` capture added while chasing it stays: it is what would have named this in one run instead of five |
| 7 | 6 | A status byte naming why a write was refused | **`R1 = 0xFF`, `R2 = 0xFF`** — and the diagnostic decoded them bit by bit into *write-protect violation, card locked, CC error, ECC failed, out of range*: five unrelated catastrophes at once. **`0xFF` is not a status byte.** Every valid R1 has bit 7 clear; `0xFF` is MISO idling high with nothing driving it | The card had **stopped answering**, not refused. The decode has been corrected to say so before touching a bit — the guard the init path had from the start and the write path never inherited. The reported `data token = 0xE5` was also stale, left by an earlier attempt the write never reached; the capture is cleared per attempt now and a host test holds it. **The write-protect reading was wrong and would have condemned a working card** |
| 8 | 6 | A card that reads is a card that writes | **The card initialised, read its BPB, FAT and directory, then went silent on the very first `CMD24` and stayed silent — the read-back after also failed.** A fresh `SdCard::begin()` in row 6.6 seconds later brought it straight back, boot count incrementing normally | Not closed. A card that is damaged stays damaged; this one recovers on re-initialisation, so it is dropping out rather than failing. `CMD24` is the first moment in the run that the card draws programming current, which points at its supply rather than at the card or the bus. Row 6.3 now re-initialises after a total write failure and reports whether it comes back, so the next run says this outright instead of leaving it to be inferred |
| 9 | 5 · 6 | The radio dragging the rail down would explain the card dropping out | **With the RA-02's VCC wire physically removed, the card still went silent on the first `CMD24` and still came back on a fresh init.** Confirmed by the run of 2026-09-05 with `boot_count = 5` | The radio is cleared of [F-8](#findings). Two faults, not one. The radio's own `0x00` is separately unexplained and confined to NSS (GP17), RESET (GP20) and its VCC/GND pins — the card proves the shared lines carry data |
| 10 | 6 | A card that reads is a card that writes | **The 3V3 jumper from the Pico to the microSD reader.** With a long jumper the card initialised, read its BPB, FAT and directory, then went silent on the very first `CMD24` and stayed silent until re-initialised — five runs in a row. **Replacing it with a short one fixed it outright: 100/100 written, then 3672 in ten seconds.** Nothing else changed | Closed. The reader is a 3.3 V board with no regulator and two capacitors ([F-3](../hardware/receiving-inspection.md#findings)), so the write-current spike arrives down whatever the supply jumper can deliver, and reads never draw enough to expose it. **On the soldered board this becomes a short track and a 470 µF bulk capacitor across the module's own 3V3 and GND**, which is now a requirement rather than a precaution |
| 11 | 6 · 8 | Write latency small against the 33 ms sensor period | **29.756 ms worst case**, against a `sensor_period_ms` of 33. The mean is 6.160 ms and the sustained rate is 2.7 ms/write, so this is an occasional stall — the card's own housekeeping — not the typical cost | Open, and it needs a row. `RawBlockLog` writes the record block **and** rewrites its header, so one telemetry append is **two** writes: a bad second can block the loop for ~60 ms, close to two whole sensor periods. Row 3.8 measured 0.453 ms of loop jitter **with no SD logging running**, so the figure that matters has not been taken. Gate 8 needs a jitter measurement with the logger active before this is called safe. **Not closed by [F-10](#findings), and no longer rare.** The soldered board's fourth session gave **28.031 ms worst against a 6.128 ms mean**, so ~30 ms has now been seen **twice in four sessions** on two different boards. A stall that reproduces is a design input, not an anomaly: two writes per append means a bad second can block the loop for ~56 ms, close to two whole sensor periods |
| 6 | 6 · 7 | Nothing — this row exists because the previous run's failure vanished | **The previous power cycle failed every write (row 6.6 `logger init FAILED`, row 7.3 30 write failures) while all 200 reads passed. The next power cycle, with an unchanged write path, wrote 100/100 in 6.3, 2667 in 6.3b and 30/30 in 7.3** | **Closed by [F-10](#findings).** The write path was never changed, only instrumented, so the fault was always outside the code — and it was the microSD's 3V3 jumper. That also explains why it appeared to come and go: the same marginal wire delivers enough on one seating and not the next. [F-5](#findings) turned out to be the identical fault on the RA-02 |

| 12 | 6 · 7 | The same card that initialised in **32 ms** on 2026-09-05 to do so again | **3 failures in the first 4 runs on the soldered board, then 11 consecutive passes.** The failures were CMD0 no-response once and ACMD41 timeout at ~2007 ms with `R1 = 0xFF` twice; the passes include 31 ms ACMD41, 100/100 writes, 3598 writes in 10 s at 100 % duty, and every row of Gate 7 | **Bounded, not closed.** `0xFF` was never a slow card — an initialising card answers `0x01` until it answers `0x00`, so it had stopped responding. **The supply is measured innocent:** the module's own `3V3` read 3.28 V *during* a failing run, and the rail held 3.28–3.29 V under 45 back-to-back transmits, so this is not [F-10](#findings) again. **What ten clean runs are worth:** by the rule of three, zero failures in ten trials bounds the per-run rate at roughly **30 % at 95 % confidence** — a weak bound. A 1-in-10 fault survives this test 35 % of the time. **What is more persuasive is the clustering:** 3 failures in 4 and then 0 in 11 is very unlikely at a constant rate, which favours *something changed* over *random intermittent*. Nobody can name what changed, and that is the open part. **A static bench run is also the wrong test for a mechanical fault on a vehicle that is launched** — provocation and vibration are. Next: try to provoke it by flexing the board and pressing the card mid-run, reflow the module's six joints, and re-take this row after any mechanical work |

| 13 | 3 · 8 | Gyro bias to repeat between sessions, since startup calibration removes whatever it finds | **Z bias moved from −0.4720 to −0.0628 dps between 2026-09-05 and 2026-09-07 — 0.41 dps.** X and Y repeated to within 0.09 and 0.05 | **Open, and it is the yaw budget rather than a curiosity.** Startup calibration removes the bias *present at boot*, so a bias that is stable across a flight costs nothing. What this shows is that Z bias **moves by ~0.4 dps between sessions**, and the obvious driver is temperature — the die read **35.6 °C** on the bench, and flight is colder at altitude and warmer from self-heating. **0.4 dps held for a 180 s flight is 72° of yaw error**, and this vehicle has [no magnetometer](#findings) to catch it: yaw is gyro-integrated and reported `YR-G`. The number to want is not the bench bias but the **drift after calibration, across a temperature change** — which nothing has measured. A cheap first look: calibrate, then warm or cool the board and watch integrated yaw walk |
| 14 | 3 | The BMP280's reported temperature to resemble ambient air | **32.96 °C at the barometer while the IMU die read 35.6 °C**, both well above a normal room | **Not a fault, and correct for its own use.** The BMP280 needs *die* temperature for its pressure compensation and that is what it is measuring. But the same figure is carried in telemetry, where it reads as an air temperature and **is not one** — it is board temperature, biased warm by self-heating and by sitting beside a transmitting radio. Either label the field as board temperature or stop treating it as ambient; the altitude it compensates is unaffected either way |

| 15 | 3 · 6 | **CLOSED 2026-09-07.** The microphone's readings to reach the SD log, as rows 3.11 and 3.12 instruct | **They reach nothing.** The sound data is read, validated, fault-managed and counted into `health_.sound_ok` — and is then discarded | **Open, and it makes rows 3.11 and 3.12 untakeable as written.** The chain breaks in two places. `TelemetryBuilder::build()` copies the sound fields into `Built` (lines 81–85) and `sd_line()` renders them (lines 139–143) — but **`sd_line()` and `sd_header()` are called only from `flight_tests.cpp`**, never from the flight path. And `PicoSdLogger::append()` takes `(const TelemetryRecord&, const std::string& packet)` and **writes only `packet`**, discarding its first argument; it never sees `Built` at all. The packet itself carries no sound either — its optional fields are GPS lat/lon/alt plus `MODE`, `FAULTS`, `CAL`, `ARM` and `YR`, and `telemetry.cpp` has no mention of sound. **So the additional sensor this vehicle chose over a magnetometer produces data that reaches neither the radio nor the card.** **And the same root cause has a second consequence, found 2026-09-07 by extracting a real log.** `PicoSdLogger::initialize()` writes a hand-rolled **comma**-separated column header — `team_id,packet,mission_time,…` — and then `append()` writes the **radio packet**, which is **semicolon**-separated tagged fields: `CAN-Team-25; P-001; Ti-00:00:00:000; A-38.8; …`. So the header does not describe the rows, and the file does not open as a spreadsheet — which is the stated reason the header is written at all. `sd_header()` and `sd_line()` are a matched pair that would produce both correctly, and neither is called. The interface is the constraint: `append()` would need the rendered `sd_line()`, or `Built`, rather than a packet string.<br><br>**Fixed 2026-09-07.** `SdLogger::append()` now takes **one rendered line** and the controller passes `builder_.sd_line(...)`, so rendering lives with `TelemetryBuilder` where `sd_header()` and `sd_line()` are a matched pair the tests hold to the same column count. `PicoSdLogger::initialize()` writes `TelemetryBuilder::sd_header()` instead of a second hand-rolled copy of the column list. **Rows 3.11 and 3.12 are takeable again.**<br><br>**And the guard was pointing the wrong way.** `test_a_working_microphone_reaches_the_log()` iterated `logger.packets` and required the level to be **absent** — the opposite of its own name — and passed. It now checks the radio does not carry it and the log does |

| 16 | 6 · 7 | The card to initialise under the flight firmware as it does under the bring-up image — they share the same drivers deliberately | **It failed every time under `cansat_pico_firmware` while passing twelve consecutive times under `cansat_bringup_firmware`** | **Root cause found, and it is not the card.** `BoardPins::lora_cs` (GP17) was configured **only** in `PicoRadio::initialize()`, and `Controller::initialize()` runs `logger_.initialize()` **before** `radio_.initialize()`. So through the entire SD initialisation GP17 was an unconfigured pad — and an RP2040 pad resets with its pull-down enabled (`PADS_BANK0` reset value `0x56`, `PDE` set), which holds the line **LOW**, which on the RA-02 means **selected**. The radio drove MISO for the whole sequence and every response the card sent came back corrupted. The bring-up image passed because it initialises the radio first, so `NSS` was already high. **Fixed 2026-09-07: `ensure_spi0()` now drives both chip selects high with the bus**, so the order the drivers run in no longer matters. This is separate from [F-12](#findings), which was intermittent and measured on the bring-up image |

| 17 | 3 · 8 | Yaw to drift steadily, since nothing observes it | **It did not drift at all for 15 minutes, and then drifted hard.** From a 36.8-minute stationary log: 0–900 s gave **+0.002 dps** and ±0.8° total; 900–1800 s gave **+0.39, +0.16, +0.19 dps**; 1800–2400 s **reversed** to −0.25 and −0.39 dps. Unwrapped, yaw ran −16.9° to **+362.8°** and back to +79.0° — more than a full revolution, sitting still | **Open, and it is the more useful half of [F-13](#findings).** A gyro whose bias is simply uncalibrated drifts from the first second; this one held near zero for a quarter of an hour, so **something switched on at t ≈ 900 s** and 0.4 dps is what it costs. **Two candidates and the data cannot separate them.** Temperature moved — flat at 31.3–31.4 °C through the quiet period, then 31.4 → 32.0 °C — which is F-13's mechanism. And the GPS acquired its first fix at t = 1073 s and lost it at t = 1812 s, which brackets the positive-drift phase almost exactly; the sign flips when the fix goes. But dT/dt does not track the sign: at 1500 s the board was *cooling* at −0.04 °C/min while yaw ran +0.19 dps. **Next: re-run stationary with the GPS antenna disconnected, and again with it connected, holding temperature as steady as the bench allows.** That one comparison separates them. **The flight cost is now measured rather than projected: 0.39 dps over a 180 s flight is 70° of yaw error** |
| 18 | 6 | A fix the receiver reports to be a fix the receiver can hold | **739 fixes over 12.3 minutes from a receiver that never moved.** Median radius from the centroid **8.1 m**, 95th percentile **37.0 m**, max **50.9 m**; north spread 59.7 m, east spread 36.4 m. **Altitude ran −5.6 m to +44.2 m — a 49.8 m spread on a bench.** The median jump between consecutive 1 Hz fixes is a quiet 0.2 m, and **the largest is 55.6 m in one second** | **Open.** 55.6 m in a second is 200 km/h, and the vehicle was on a table, so that fix was wrong rather than merely imprecise. **`GpsParser` accepts it by design:** [`gps_parser.cpp`](../../firmware/flight-computer/src/gps_parser.cpp) rejects only `quality <= 0`, then stores the satellite count **without ever testing it**. There is no minimum satellite count and no HDOP check anywhere in the vehicle, so a 4-satellite fix with poor geometry is carried into telemetry exactly like a 12-satellite one. The median of 0.2 m says the receiver is mostly fine and occasionally isn't — which is the case a gate exists for. **Gated 2026-09-07:** `GpsParser` now refuses a fix below `kMinGpsSatellites` (4) or above `kMaxGpsHdop` (5.0), counts the refusals in `fixes_rejected()`, and parses HDOP -- which it previously discarded -- into `GpsData::hdop` so the numbers the gate judges on are readable. A refused fix leaves the previous position untouched: declining an update is not the same as losing the fix, and only `quality <= 0` clears it. **Still open, because this log cannot say whether the gate would have caught the 55.6 m jump** -- neither the SD row nor the radio packet carries satellite count or HDOP, so the very quantity F-18 turns on was never recorded. Re-run the stationary test and check `fixes_rejected()` against the wander. **A gate had to be designed against descent, not the bench:** the vehicle is falling under a parachute and drifting downwind when this matters, so a plain speed limit tuned to a stationary bench would reject the real flight. Satellite count and HDOP do not have that problem. **And the gate was bypassed until 2026-09-11:** an `RMC` sentence set a fix on its own, with no satellite count, HDOP or altitude to gate on, and the 2026-09-10 range-test log shows 219 such fixes on the air — 0 satellites, HDOP 0.0, `GP-Alt-0.0`. `RMC` now renews the ground track only, and a refused `GGA` no longer renews the fix clock |
| 19 | 6 | [F-15](#findings)'s fix to reach the card it was written for | **The recovered `FLIGHT.CSV` still carries the old 19-column header** — `team_id,packet,mission_time,…` — above 21-column `sd_line` rows that start with `mission_ms`. And the *same file* holds two different row formats: the earliest records in flight 1 are raw semicolon-separated radio packets, the later ones are the comma-separated columns | **Open, and it is a launch-day trap rather than a code bug.** [`sd_logger.cpp`](../../firmware/flight-computer/src/pico/sd_logger.cpp) writes the header `if (healthy_ && log_.record_count() == 0)` — **only into an empty log**. F-15's fix is therefore invisible on any card that already holds records, and this card was at boot count 3 spanning the fix. The rows are right; the line above them is not, so the file opens as a spreadsheet with every column mislabelled, which is worse than no header. **Mitigation today: re-prepare the card before flight** with [`tools/prepare_sd_card.py`](../../tools/prepare_sd_card.py), which is worth doing anyway so a flight log starts empty. **The fix to consider: compare the stored header against `sd_header()` on resume and rewrite it when it differs**, rather than testing whether the log is empty |

| 20 | 8 | `FLIGHT -> LANDED` to fire when the vehicle lands | **It fires while the vehicle is hanging under the drone.** Landing detection asks whether acceleration is within 2.5 m/s² of 1 g and vertical speed is below 1 m/s, both held for `landing_confirm_ms` (3 s). **A hover answers yes to both.** Run against the real `StateMachine` with a 3 m/s climb to 30 m and a 20 s hover: `READY -> FLIGHT` at 10.362 s, **`FLIGHT -> LANDED` at 18.018 s**, `LANDED -> RECOVERY` at 23.034 s — twelve seconds before release | **Closed 2026-09-08.** Found by analysis the same day, while writing [concept-of-operations.md](../mission/concept-of-operations.md), and reproduced against the unmodified state machine. **What it costs:** `MODE-` reads `RECOVERY` through the entire real descent, so anything that segments the flight by mission state is wrong; the 5 s post-impact window is spent in the air, so REC-008 is still physically satisfied — `RECOVERY` transmits — but the vehicle's own declaration that it landed is gone; and `RECOVERY` is terminal, so it never returns to `FLIGHT`. **Three seconds is a short hover**, and the exposure is wider than hovering: any 3 s interval with a vertical rate under 1 m/s does it, including a gentle lift at less than 1 m/s. **`min_flight_ms` does not catch it** — it suppresses landing detection for the first 3 s of `FLIGHT`, which on a drone lift is entered at 15 m during the ascent and used up long before the hover. **The fix to consider:** a vehicle cannot land without descending first, so latch a flag when a sustained descent has actually been observed (vertical speed below −2 m/s held ~1 s) and refuse `FLIGHT -> LANDED` until it is set. That is physical rather than threshold-tuned and a hover cannot satisfy it. An altitude gate near the ground baseline would also work, but leans on barometric altitude still being trustworthy after several minutes of drift. **Fixed 2026-09-08 — the descent gate.** `StateMachine` now latches `descent_observed_` when the vertical rate has been below `-landing_descent_rate_mps` (2 m/s) for `landing_descent_confirm_ms` (1 s), and refuses `FLIGHT -> LANDED` until it is set. **The at-rest timer does not even start without it**, so a hover cannot accumulate towards a landing and then fire the moment the gate opens. The latch clears on any state change, so a descent seen in an earlier state cannot authorise a landing in this one. Both thresholds are checked by `validate_config()`: the descent rate must exceed the at-rest rate, or one sample could mean both, and the confirm window may not be zero. **Re-run against the same reproduction:** `FLIGHT` at 10.362 s as before, then nothing through the twenty-second hover, `LANDED` at **44.022 s** — three seconds after touchdown — and `RECOVERY` at 49.038 s, with the post-impact window spent on the ground where the rulebook wants it. Covered by `test_a_hovering_drone_is_not_a_landing` and four others. **The thresholds remain PROVISIONAL** like every other detection threshold: tune them against real drop data |
| 21 | 8 | The vehicle's altitude to be its height above the pad | **On a hot day it reads about 5 % low.** `sensors::pressure_altitude_m()` is the ISA formula, `44330 (1 - (p/p0)^(1/5.255))`, which assumes the standard atmosphere's temperature; real height per pascal scales with the real absolute temperature, so at 31 °C the altitude is short by 288 K ÷ 304 K. Found while writing the post-flight analysis, 2026-09-14, not on a bench | **Open in the firmware, corrected in the analysis.** The sealed image cannot change. It matters twice: every transmitted `A-` is ~5 % low, and **a descent rate taken from it is ~5 % low**, which is the difference between a 5.05 m/s descent and a compliant-looking 4.8. [`analysis/flight_analysis.py`](../../analysis/flight_analysis.py) takes the descent from temperature-corrected height (the hypsometric equation, with the measured pad pressure and temperature), reports both rates, and reports the scale it found against the one theory predicts. The launch-detection threshold is affected the same way — 15 m as measured is ~15.8 m of real climb — which changes nothing on a 30 m lift. **Fix to consider for any later image:** compute altitude hypsometrically from the calibrated pad temperature |

When a finding changes a constant, change it in the source, re-run
`bash tools/build_host.sh` — which will tell you if a document now contradicts it — and add
a row to [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md).

## Flight results, 30 Sep 2026

**Appended 2026-10-02. The rows above are not rewritten**: they record what was predicted
and what the bench gave before the launch. This section sets the flight quantities beside
what the launch measured. The vehicle was **thrown by hand from a terrace at about 29.5 m**
(96-97 ft), not lifted by a drone, under a **6 ft (1.83 m)** canopy; the 80 cm figure used
in the predictions is the model's guaranteed minimum, not what flew. Source: the organizers'
ground station export, analysed in
[`analysis/flight-2026-09-30/`](../../analysis/flight-2026-09-30/README.md) with every number
in `results.json`. Packets are counted as **received** only. Measured by the analysis, not
signed off row by row, so the verdict column is left for the team.

| Quantity | Predicted | Measured in flight | Reading |
|---|---|---|---|
| Descent rate | 4.37-5.00 m/s for the 80 cm minimum canopy ([concept of operations](../mission/concept-of-operations.md#phase-by-phase)); 1.97-2.18 m/s for the 6 ft canopy over 450-550 g (2.07 at 500 g) | Flight 1 **2.27 +/- 0.05 m/s** (temperature-corrected, R2 0.991; 2.16 m/s from the transmitted altitude). Flight 2 **1.88 +/- 0.02 m/s** (R2 0.9988) | Far below the rulebook's 5 m/s. Against the 500 g prediction: +9 % and -9 %. Implied Cd 0.57-0.69 (F1), 0.82-1.00 (F2), against the 0.75 assumed |
| Descent time | 14-15.6 s from 29.5 m (6 ft canopy model) | Flight 2: 29.6 m in 15.4 s | Inside the predicted range |
| Link margin | Positive over the -123 dBm SF7 sensitivity ([link budget](../design/link-budget.md)) | RSSI -109 to -79 dBm; **margin at least 14 dB, mean 31 dB**; RSSI rose about 14 dB at the throw | Link closed at the terrace distance, with margin |
| Max-rate cadence | Rich, lean, lean in 374 / 296 / 296 ms slots, 3.11 Hz on the bench | **3.09 Hz**, gaps 0.374 / 0.296 / 0.297 s | The designed pattern, reproduced |
| Command-window cadence | 1.43 Hz | Flight 2 powered at the terrace was in the 1.43 Hz window (`ST-R003`) | As designed |
| Packet size | Under the 200 byte ceiling | At most **188 bytes**; rich 136-188 B, lean 118-130 B | Under the ceiling |
| Post-impact transmission | At least 5 s (REC-008) | **12.95 s / 41 packets** after Flight 1; the vehicle restarted about 2 s after the end of the record (consistent with the 2 s watchdog), calibrated in 5.5 s and re-armed | Requirement met. At rest 1.000 g (9.811 +/- 0.015 m/s2), altitude 0.0 +/- 0.1 m, GPS fix kept |
| Structural load | 100 N study load; Fusion 360 peaks 2.885 / 1.330 / 2.345 MPa | Throw impulse 5.2 g; canopy load 2.1 g (F1) and 1.93 g (F2); touchdown kinetic energy about 0.8-1.4 J; a 25 ms stop is about 34-50 N | Well inside the study load; the vehicle kept transmitting |
| Altitude formula | ISA formula plus ground baseline reproduces itself; reads low on a hot day ([F-21](#findings)) | Transmitted altitude reproduced to +/- 0.03 m; **5.7 % small at 31 degrees C** against the hypsometric equation | Confirms F-21 in flight; rates were taken from temperature-corrected height |
| Launch detection | Carry past 15 m, held 300 ms, arms first | Armed about 18:19; state `ST-F111` for the whole record after the carry up the building; throw at 18:25:51 (P-1599) | Worked as designed for a carried-up, thrown vehicle |

Not predicted, and now known: the throw is the loudest packet of Flight 1 (36.3 mV p-p);
under canopy the GPS drifted about 9.4 m at about 1.9 m/s toward 341 degrees, with fixes in
every rich packet.
