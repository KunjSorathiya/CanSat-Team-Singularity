# Scoring Assessment — CanSat 2026, 200 Points

Where this project stands against
[the 2026 rulebook](../requirements/updated%20CanSat%20Final%20Guidelines%202026.pdf), what
it would score today, and what the cheapest remaining points are.

> **This is an estimate, and half of it is a judgement call about work nobody has done yet.**
> Sections D and F are scored on appearance, craftsmanship and presentation; section C's
> descent scoring is explicitly *comparative across teams*, so no absolute figure is
> knowable. Every number below is stated with what it assumes.

**Assessed 2026-09-05, against the bring-up state recorded in
[bring-up-record.md](../testing/bring-up-record.md). Section B's rate and section C's
descent figures were revised 2026-09-08; sections C, D and F on 2026-09-12, when the
structure was printed; and the whole page on 2026-09-14, at submission.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The tables below are the assessment at submission, 2026-09-14, before the launch**, kept
> as the record. **The vehicle then flew on 2026-09-30** (two descents, thrown by hand from a
> terrace at about 29.5 m). The organizers' scores are not in this repository, so **no score is
> stated after the flights** — what changed is the *evidence*, set out in
> [After the flights](#after-the-flights-2026-10-02) below. Points that depend on a flight are
> now *evidenced by measurement*, but how the organizers scored them, and the comparative
> descent scoring against other teams, is not known here.

## Summary

| Section | Max | **Secured at submission** | **Achievable** | Gap |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| A · Payload safety | 25 | **0** | **5** | Egg test declined — 20 points forgone by choice. Canopy built, deployment scored at the launch |
| B · Telemetry & communication | 25 | **0** | 23 | Scored on what the organizers' station receives in flight |
| C · Parachute, descent, stability | 25 | **~5** | 23 | **Switch and power LED fitted.** Descent, stability and landing scored at the launch |
| D · Structural & material innovation | 30 | **~12** | 26 | Structure, egg chamber and canopy built. Build quality is judged from photographs |
| E · Technical design & analysis | 70 | **~29** | 58 | Perfboard, not PCB; sensor integration at its cap; analysis needs flight data |
| F · Final report | 25 | **~20** | 24 | **Report submitted.** Imaging not recorded in the repository |
| **Total** | **200** | **~66** | **~159** | |

**What moved at submission.** The manual switch and the power LED were fitted — section C's
five bare-minimum points, and the cheapest points on the board — and the canopy was sewn, the
vehicle ballasted into the mass band, and the report submitted (reported by the team, 2026-09-14).

> **The team elected not to fly an egg payload**, on personal grounds. The 20 points for egg
> integrity are forgone, and every figure in this document reflects that. The 5 points for
> parachute deployment are unaffected.

**"Secured"** counts only what is built and evidenced, or reported built where no flight is
needed to score it. **"Achievable"** assumes the flight succeeds. It is not a ceiling; it is
what this design earns without changing its approach.

**The rest of the gap is the launch.** Nothing else can move sections A, B or C now, and
nothing in this repository can predict the comparative descent scoring against other teams.

## After the flights (2026-10-02)

Update 2026-10-02. The vehicle flew twice on 2026-09-30 at the competition launch, recorded by
the organizers' ground station. Every number is from
[`analysis/flight-2026-09-30/results.json`](../../analysis/flight-2026-09-30/) and is
discussed in chapter 14 of the [final project report](CanSat-2026-Final-Project-Report.pdf).
**The flights were a hand throw from a terrace at 29.4–29.6 m, not a drone release** from
100 ft (30.48 m); the rulebook's own "100 ft is about an eight-storey building" was the
reference the team used. Whether the organizers accepted that as the release altitude is not
recorded here. These are the measurements; this page does not convert them to points.

| Section | What the flights measured | What stays unknown |
|---|---|---|
| A · Safety | Canopy opened both times (loaded about 0.97 s after apex in Flight 1, 2.1 g); no egg flown, no egg result claimed | Egg points remain forgone by team decision |
| B · Telemetry | 102 distinct packets received over the link; 41 and 18 in the two descents, 41 in the 12.95 s after Flight 1's impact; 3.09 Hz in Flight 1; link margin at least 14 dB (mean 31 dB) over the SF7 sensitivity; packets at most 188 bytes, under the 200-byte ceiling; GPS fix in every rich packet; sound in packets (the throw was the loudest) | The organizers' own packet accounting and scoring |
| C · Descent, stability, integrity | Steady descent **2.27 ± 0.05 m/s** (Flight 1) and **1.88 ± 0.02 m/s** (Flight 2), both under the 5 m/s cap; swing at most 18° and 46° from vertical; touchdown about 0.8–1.4 J by model; the vehicle kept transmitting after impact (it restarted itself after Flight 1 within about 2 s, recalibrated in 5.5 s and was heard 12.95 s) | Comparative ranking against other teams; the post-landing condition of the structure is not on record |
| E · Data analysis | The analysis tool was run on the real export; results recovered throw impulse, apex, descent rate, implied drag coefficient (0.57–0.69 and 0.82–1.00 over 450–550 g), swing and GPS drift | How the organizers judged it |
| F · Report | The 14 September report is superseded by the new final project report, with photographs of the vehicle, board and web console | Whether video and social posts were made |

Two lessons the model got wrong in useful ways: the descent model's 0.75 Cd predicted
1.97–2.18 m/s for the 6 ft canopy, and the flights landed +9 % and −9 % about the 500 g
prediction; and the altitude formula the vehicle transmits reads 5.7 % small at 31 °C against
the hypsometric equation, which is why the rates were taken from temperature-corrected height.

## Section by section

### A · Payload Safety — 25 points

| Item | Points | Status |
|---|---:|---|
| Egg recovered unbroken | 20 | **Forgone by team decision.** Scored as 0 |
| Parachute deployment | 5 | **Canopy sewn and fitted** (reported by the team, 2026-09-14). *Update 2026-10-02: it deployed in both flights on 2026-09-30.* Organizer score not on record |

**Omitting the egg is not a disqualification.** The rulebook's disqualification list is
closed and specific: exceeding size or mass by more than 10 %, unsafe deployment, no attempt
at a communication system, arriving late, or violating the code of conduct. An absent egg
appears on none of them, so this costs 20 points and nothing else.

**Two consequences worth planning around, neither of them the points.**

**First, build the egg chamber anyway — and it is now built.** It was printed with the
structure and fitted on 2026-09-12, and it is inside the 280 g the assembled vehicle weighs.
The reasoning it was built on stands: section 8 requires "a cushioned and secure chamber
specifically designed to hold the egg payload", and the general rules list an egg payload
among the mandatory systems. A chamber that exists and demonstrably works is compliance with
a stated requirement; an absent chamber invites a judge to read "mandatory system missing"
more broadly than the 20 points. The chamber also carries its own **+7 cm** dimensional
allowance, and section D scores effective use of the volume the rules permit — so building it
costs nothing and protects marks elsewhere. Whether anything rides inside it on the day is a
separate question from whether it was engineered.

**Second, it changes the tie-break.** Ties are broken on payload safety first, telemetry
accuracy second, descent stability third. At 5 of 25 in the first category, a tie is likely
to go the other way — which makes the second and third categories worth more than their raw
point value. Both are areas this project is strong in.

**Worth one email to the organizers:** whether declining the egg carries any consequence
beyond the 20 points, given the general rules call it mandatory. The disqualification list
says no. Getting that in writing costs nothing and removes the only real uncertainty here.

The 2026 revision adds a specific constraint worth designing to now: the parachute **must
not be tightly packed** — it has to be external or semi-exposed so it deploys instantly on
release. A chute stuffed inside the body risks both the 5 points and a disqualification for
unsafe deployment.

### B · Telemetry & Communication — 25 points

| Item | Points | Assessment |
|---|---:|---|
| Real-time data transmission | 20 | **20 achievable.** The firmware satisfies every stated condition |
| Transmission capability & reliability | 5 | **Improved.** No longer at the floor: **1.43 Hz**, 43 % above the minimum, from moving GPS out of the packet (56 bytes) and sizing the period from measured rather than modelled airtime. The remaining headroom needs 250 kHz bandwidth, which costs 3 dB of sensitivity |
| Data format compliance | gate | **Compliant** |

What is already right, and verified:

- **Transmits automatically on power-up** with no manual trigger — a 2026 requirement.
- **Continuous from power-on through landing**, and `post_impact_transmission_ms` is held at
  ≥ 5000 ms by `validate_config()`, which refuses to build otherwise.
- **Format is exact**, held to `test-data/protocol-fixtures.tsv` by three independent parsers
  in C++, Python and JavaScript.
- **Team identity enforced** — the firmware refuses to run as `CAN-Team-XX`, and the
  rulebook awards zero telemetry points for a wrong team number regardless of transmission
  success.
- **Radio is compatible with an official ground station** — SX1278 RA-02, one of the two the
  Physics Club provides. Confirmed on the bench: version register `0x12`, airtime within
  1.8 % of the model.

**Taken 2026-09-08:** the rulebook rewards packet rates above 1 Hz, and this vehicle was at
exactly the minimum. It now transmits at **1.43 Hz**. Two changes, neither of which costs a
point elsewhere: GPS moved from the packet to the log — SEN-011 is scored on data
*transmitted or logged*, so its +5 is untouched — and the period sized from the measured
airtime rather than the model, which reads 1.8 % low.

**What it costs is not a score, it is recovery.** With the position off the air the ground
station cannot say where the vehicle is, in descent or after landing, and the fix is on a
card inside the thing you are looking for. `transmit_gps` restores it at 1.18 Hz. That is a
launch-day judgement about the site, not a scoring one.

### C · Parachute, Descent, Stability & Integrity — 25 points

| Item | Points | Assessment |
|---|---:|---|
| Descent rate & stability | 6 | **Canopy built, never dropped at submission** (*update 2026-10-02: measured 2.27 and 1.88 m/s on 2026-09-30, see above*). 4.37–5.00 m/s by model for the 80 cm canopy across the mass band; scored *comparatively against other teams* |
| Sensor data continuity | 9 | **7–9 achievable.** The firmware's strongest area |
| Structural integrity & post-landing transmission | 5 | Post-landing transmission is enforced in firmware; the structure had never been dropped at submission (two landings on 2026-09-30; see above) |
| Bare minimum: manual switch + power LED | 5 | **~5. Both fitted** (reported by the team, 2026-09-14) |

Sensor continuity is where the software earns its keep: faults are classified rather than
fatal, a failed sensor degrades the packet instead of stopping it, and the packet number is
not consumed when mandatory data is invalid. A dropped sensor mid-descent costs a field, not
the stream.

**Descent time is scored comparatively** — longer stable descents score higher, subject to
≤ 5 m/s. That makes chute sizing a competitive decision, not just a safety one.

**And the decision now has arithmetic under it.** [`simulations/descent.py`](../../simulations/descent.py)
sizes the canopy: **80.0 cm** flat diameter brings 550 g down at exactly 5.00 m/s on a hot
day. Three things follow that are worth knowing before any cloth is cut:

- **Size at the top of the mass tolerance, not the nominal mass.** Canopy area is linear in
  mass, so ±10 % of mass is ±10 % of area but only ~5 % of diameter. A canopy sized at 500 g
  and flown at 550 g **breaks the 5 m/s cap**; one sized at 550 g is compliant across the
  whole band and costs 6 cm of cloth.
- **Scoring rewards a slow descent, and the cap is a ceiling on rate, not a target.** Sizing
  *larger* than 80 cm descends more slowly and scores better, at the cost of more drift and a
  bulkier pack. That is a live trade, and this is the tool to make it with.
- **The descent is 6.45–7.28 seconds** across the mass band. At the 3.11 Hz the vehicle
  transmits after its command window that is **about twenty packets** — the entire
  over-the-air descent dataset. The SD log records the same rows — **one per packet, not at
  the 30 Hz sensor rate** — but loses none to the link and carries the columns the packet
  omits, so section E's analysis should be built on the card.

### D · Structural & Material Innovation — 30 points

| Item | Points | Status |
|---|---:|---|
| Compactness & efficiency | 5 | **~3.** 118.5 × 115 × 110 mm inside a 210 × 120 mm allowance — comfortably compliant, but **91.5 mm of permitted height is unused**, and this line scores *effective use of the volume the rules permit* |
| Structural & material design (CAD, justification) | 5 | **~5.** Fusion 360 model, STEP export, three static-stress studies, a written material argument, and a print orientation chosen on strength grounds and recorded |
| Fabrication & innovation | 5 | **~4.** Printed in-house from the team's own CAD in PETG, which is the rulebook's own example of a bonus-worthy material |
| Aesthetics & build quality | 15 | **Now judgeable, and unphotographed.** The part exists in white PETG with the electronics mounted. This is where the remaining points are |

**This section moved from zero to roughly 12 on 2026-09-12**, and it did so without a
purchase. 15 of its 30 points are aesthetics and build quality — neatness, cable management,
labelling, finish — which is unusually high weighting for presentation, and it is won or lost
during assembly rather than design.

**Three things to do next, in order of points per hour:**

1. **Photograph it properly.** Top, side and bottom views are mandatory for section F anyway,
   and this section is judged on what those photographs show. White PETG photographs cleanly
   against almost anything, which was part of the reason for choosing it.
2. **Dress the wiring.** The board is a hand-wired perfboard inside a printed frame; cable
   management and labelling are explicitly named in this section, and they cost an evening.
3. **Consider the 91.5 mm of unused height.** Compactness scores *effective use* of permitted
   volume, and this design uses 56 % of the height it is allowed. It is also, not
   coincidentally, where 105–135 g of missing mass could go — see
   [the mass budget](../../mechanical/README.md#the-risk-did-not-just-materialise-it-grew).
   One change answers a scored line and a disqualification risk together.

The rulebook explicitly permits any outer material (PVC, plastic, 3D print) and offers a
**bonus for sustainable or unconventional materials** — 3D printed, recycled, composites.
**PETG qualifies and the argument is written down**, which is the part most teams miss:
[mechanical/README.md](../../mechanical/README.md#material-and-manufacture) says why PETG
rather than PLA or ABS, and the [simulation write-up](../../mechanical/simulation/README.md)
says what the studies do and do not establish about a printed part.

### E · Technical Design & Analysis — 70 points

| Item | Points | Secured | Assessment |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| PCB design | 15 | ~0 | Perfboard, not a custom PCB |
| Code originality | 10 | **~9** | The strongest single area in the project |
| Sensor integration | 25 | **25** | 15 mandatory + 5 GPS + 5 microphone — **at the cap**, and a further sensor adds nothing here |
| Data analysis | 20 | ~0 | **Analysis written and tested before the launch**; scored on the flight's data. *Update 2026-10-02: run on the real export, see above* |

**Code originality — 9 or 10 of 10.** Self-written, no third-party libraries anywhere in the
flight path, heavily commented, and held by 4879 assertions across 229 Python and 62 Node
tests. The drivers for the MPU-9250, BMP280, NEO-6M, SX1278 and the SD card are all written
here against their datasheets and register maps. This section rewards exactly what this
repository is.

**Since this was assessed, three things have been added that strengthen it further:** an
authorised ground-to-vehicle command that is inert by construction, a GPS fix gate on
satellite count and HDOP, and a descent model held to closed-form limits by its own tests.

**Sensor integration — 25 of 25.** The mandatory set is complete and worth 15 in the
2026 revision (it was worth nothing in the previous one — **this is a scoring change in our
favour**): gyroscope and accelerometer, pressure and altitude, and LoRa telemetry. GPS adds
the first +5.

**The second +5 is being taken by the analogue microphone**, integrated on `GP27` and
logging an acoustic level for the whole flight. That closes the section at its 25-point cap.

**A word on what that cap means, because it is easy to plan against the wrong number.**
Sensor integration is worth **25 and no more**. The mandatory set is 15, GPS is the first
+5, and the microphone is the second — which reaches 25. **A third additional sensor scores
nothing in this section.** A hall effect sensor added afterwards is worth zero points here,
and anyone expecting two sensors to be worth ten is going to be disappointed by five of
them. It can still earn its place: an extra channel of flight data feeds section E's data
analysis, where correlations and descent profiles carry marks, and a sensor with a real
purpose is something to write about in the report. But not in this section, and not for the
reason people usually add it.

**The magnetometer's absence is still a live problem, and it is not a scoring one.**
[F-1](../hardware/receiving-inspection.md#findings): the module sold as an MPU-9250 turned
out to be an MPU-6500, so the vehicle has no absolute yaw. Yaw is a **mandatory** telemetry
field (`TEL-017`, `SEN-010`) and this vehicle can only send a relative, gyro-propagated one
declared `YR-G`. Whether that is acceptable is an **unanswered organizer question**. The
microphone takes the points the magnetometer would have taken; it does not answer that
question, and nothing but a magnetometer or an organizer's "yes" will.

### The science case for an acoustic sensor

This is the part to put in front of a judge, and it is worth making properly: a microphone
on a descending probe is a flight-proven atmospheric instrument, not a novelty.

**Flight heritage.** Mars 2020 *Perseverance* carried a microphone dedicated to entry,
descent and landing, and a second on SuperCam that measures wind and the acoustics of its
laser sparks. The *Huygens* probe that descended through Titan's atmosphere in 2005 carried
an acoustic sensor inside its HASI instrument package. The Soviet *Venera 13* and *14*
landers recorded wind noise on the surface of Venus. Acoustics is one of the cheapest ways
to instrument a descent, which is exactly why it keeps being flown.

**What it measures on this vehicle, in order of confidence:**

1. **Parachute deployment, timed independently.** Canopy inflation is a sharp broadband
   transient. The accelerometer sees the deceleration; the microphone sees the event itself.
   Two independent witnesses to the single most critical moment of the mission — and if they
   disagree, that disagreement is a finding rather than a mystery.
2. **Touchdown.** Impact is an impulsive transient far above the descent noise floor. It
   confirms landing without relying on the altitude trace flattening, which is exactly what
   a barometer does badly near the ground.
3. **Descent rate, by an independent route.** Aerodynamic noise rises steeply with airspeed —
   turbulent surface pressure fluctuations scale roughly with the sixth power of velocity,
   and free turbulence faster still. The acoustic level should therefore track descent rate,
   giving a cross-check on the barometric rate that shares none of its failure modes. A
   barometer in a pressure-disturbed wake and a microphone are wrong in different ways.
4. **Canopy stability.** A parachute that is oscillating or breathing modulates the noise
   periodically. The frequency of that modulation is the oscillation frequency, measurable
   from a single channel with no extra hardware — and section C of the rulebook cares about
   descent stability.
5. **The atmosphere itself, in principle.** The speed of sound is `sqrt(γRT/M)`: it depends
   on temperature and on what the gas is made of, which is how Huygens used acoustics at
   Titan. A single microphone cannot do time-of-flight, so this vehicle does not claim it —
   but it is the reason the instrument class exists, and it is the honest answer to "what
   would you do with more of these".

#### What the LM393 board specifically can and cannot do

The module on this vehicle is an **LM393 sound detection sensor**: an electret capsule, a
comparator, a gain trimpot, and — on the four-pin variant — a lightly amplified analogue
output. It is a ten-rupee part and pretending otherwise in front of a judge is worse than
naming its limits first.

**Honest confidence, item by item:**

| Use | Confidence | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Landing detection** | **High** | Impact is an impulsive transient tens of decibels above anything else in the flight. Even a poor microphone and a comparator catch it |
| **Flow noise against descent rate** | **Good** | Unshielded electrets are extremely sensitive to airflow. On a descending body that is normally called a defect; here it is the measurement |
| **Canopy oscillation** | **Partial** | Carried by the envelope *between* windows, not within one. The envelope is computed every loop tick but **recorded once per packet** — 3.11 Hz in flight — so modes below about 1.5 Hz are resolvable and the upper half of the 0.5–3 Hz canopy range aliases |
| **Deployment transient** | **Moderate** | The crack is sharp and loud, but it happens exactly when flow noise is highest. The `sound_gate_pct` channel helps: a transient is a brief high peak at low duty, sustained flow noise is high duty |
| **Absolute sound pressure level** | **None** | No calibration, no reference, and an unrecorded trimpot |
| **Frequency spectra** | **None** | A 0.5 ms window resolves ~2 kHz upward, which is not where the useful content is. This vehicle does not claim spectra |

**Two channels, deliberately, and they answer different questions.** `sound_mv_pp` is *how
loud*; `sound_gate_pct` is *what fraction of the window was loud*. A sharp crack and a
steady roar can reach the same peak and mean opposite things, and the duty is what separates
them. It is also the only channel a three-pin board can produce at all.

**Fit a windscreen.** A scrap of open-cell foam over the capsule. Without one the flow noise
will saturate everything else on a descent — which makes the descent-rate proxy easy and the
deployment transient impossible. The foam trades some of the first for the second, and
mentioning that you made that trade on purpose is worth more to a judge than either result.

**What it does not measure, and say so before a judge asks.** The level is a **relative
peak-to-peak envelope in millivolts, not a sound pressure level**. Reporting decibels would
need a calibrated reference source and a record of the module's gain trimpot position, and
this project has neither. Values are comparable across one flight at one gain setting and
with nothing else. That limitation is in the firmware comments, the requirements row and the
log column name — which is itself worth pointing at, because knowing what an instrument
cannot tell you is the part that separates a measurement from a number.

### The science case for a hall effect sensor

Not yet built — its supply voltage is unconfirmed — but the argument, when it is:

**Separation detection.** A magnet on the launch carrier and the sensor on the CanSat makes
the moment of release a hardware event, at zero power and with no software in the path. It
is mechanically independent of the accelerometer, so it witnesses deployment even if the
inertial data is saturated by the release transient — which is precisely when accelerometers
are least trustworthy. Separation and deployment switches of this kind are standard
spacecraft practice.

**Line-twist diagnosis.** With a magnet on the parachute swivel, hall pulses count relative
rotation between the payload and the canopy — the thing a swivel exists to prevent. A
post-flight count of how much it twisted is a direct measurement of a recovery-system
property that is otherwise inferred from video.

**What it cannot do.** It is not a magnetometer and cannot replace one. A common hall switch
operates around 10 mT; the Earth's field is about 50 µT, some two hundred times weaker. It
gives no heading, no yaw reference, and no help at all with `TEL-017`.

**PCB design — near zero on a perfboard.** The section asks for original PCB design with
layout diagrams, minimal external wiring and well-routed traces, with a bonus for custom
boards *instead of* generic dev boards. A hand-wired single-sided prototype board with
isolated pads is the opposite of that on every criterion.

**Data analysis — the tooling is ready and unused.** The ground station already exports CSV,
the web console already plots altitude and pressure live, and the mandatory graphs are
altitude, temperature and pressure against time. Extra credit is offered for acceleration
profiles, orientation changes, descent rate and correlations — all of which are already in
the telemetry.

### F · Final Report — 25 points

| Item | Points | Assessment |
|---|---:|---|
| Structure & documentation | 20 | **~20. Written 2026-09-12, submitted 2026-09-14** — [final-report.md](final-report.md), with `.docx` and `.pdf` beside it. Design approach, architecture, mission procedure, simulations, code, flowcharts, components, timeline and lessons learned |
| Imaging & media | 5 | **Not recorded at submission.** *Update 2026-10-02: photographs of the vehicle, board and console are now in the final project report.* Whether the submission carried the required set is not recorded here |

The report asks for design approach, system architecture, mission procedure, results and
lessons learned, with schematics, wiring diagrams and CAD attached, and proper citations.
Most of that exists: `software-architecture.md`, `wiring.md`, `electrical-architecture.md`,
`link-budget.md`, `sensor-rates.md`, `test-plan.md`, `bring-up-record.md`,
`receiving-inspection.md` and this repository's changelog are a fuller engineering record
than most teams will submit.

**Lessons learned writes itself from the findings register** — a supplier's MPU-9250 that
answered as an MPU-6500, a microSD listing that described a board with a regulator when the
delivered one had none, a multimeter that invented a short circuit, and an airtime model
that survived contact with a real radio to within 1.8 %.

Media is mandatory and unstarted, and **as of 2026-09-12 nothing stands in its way**: top,
side and bottom views of the CanSat, PCB views, a team photo with the CanSat, and a group
photo with mentors. The vehicle is assembled and photogenic; this is an afternoon that is
worth 5 points in this section and feeds the 15 aesthetics points in section D.

## The cheapest points remaining

**This list was the plan to submission, and it has been played out.** What each item became:

| # | Recommendation | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Ask whether 450 g is a floor | **Moot** — the vehicle was ballasted into the band |
| 0b | Photograph the assembled vehicle | **Not recorded** in the repository |
| 1 | Manual switch and power LED — 5 points | **Taken.** Both fitted |
| 2 | Add a magnetometer | **Taken instead by the microphone**, 2026-09-05. Yaw stays relative |
| 3 | Raise the packet rate past 1 Hz | **Taken, and beyond it.** 1.43 Hz, then **3.11 Hz** after the command window, measured at the bench |
| 4 | A custom PCB — up to ~10 points | **Not done.** The vehicle flies on perfboard |
| 4b | Sew the 80 cm canopy | **Taken.** Sewn and fitted |
| 5 | Data analysis preparation — up to 20 points | **Taken 2026-09-14.** [`analysis/`](../../analysis/README.md): a notebook and a one-command CLI, tested against a synthetic flight with known answers |

**Nothing on this list is still open.** Number 5 was the last: the analysis now exists before
the flight. It writes the mandatory altitude, temperature and pressure graphs and the extra-credit
set — descent rate and drag coefficient, acceleration, orientation, spin, drift, sound and
correlations — in one command, and it corrects the vehicle's altitude for the ISA-formula bias
that would otherwise understate the descent rate by ~5 % ([F-21](../testing/bring-up-record.md#findings)).

---

## What would lose points

**Stray transmission during another team's launch. The 2026 revision made this five times
harsher: −1 point per 2 packets, where the old rulebook said per 10.** At 1 Hz that is half a
point per second, and at the 3.11 Hz the vehicle reaches after its window it is over one and a
half. The firmware is *required* to transmit on power-up, so **the fitted switch is the only
control, and the dark power LED is the only confirmation** — see the runbook.

**Wrong sync word.** `0xF3` for testing, `0xA5` for the official launch, and both ends must
change together. A mismatch is a silent, total loss of telemetry that looks exactly like a
dead radio — and it happened once, on the 2026-09-10 range test. Both Picos now fly `0xA5`.

**A lift inside the command window.** Launch detection is off until the vehicle arms, so a
drone that lifts early carries a vehicle that never declares `FLIGHT`, `LANDED` or its
post-impact window. The data still flows; the state record the judges read is wrong. **Wait
for `ST-R11…`.**

**Wrong team number or a malformed packet** zeroes the telemetry section regardless of how
well the link performs. The firmware guards both, and three parsers hold the format to one
fixture.

**Exceeding 21 cm (+7) × 12 cm or 500 g by more than 10 % is a disqualification**, not a
deduction. So is an unsafe deployment, a missing communication attempt, or arriving late.

**The mass limit could have cut both ways, and no longer does.** GEN-005 reads *"500 g
(±10%)"* as a band; GEN-006's disqualification names only *exceeding*. The assembled vehicle
weighed 280 g on 2026-09-12, 105–135 g under the lower edge once finished — and it was
**ballasted into the 450–550 g band before submission**, which satisfies either reading.
