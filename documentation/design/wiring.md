# Wiring Diagrams

Signal-level wiring for both Picos, drawn from the pin assignment the firmware actually
uses. `BoardPins` in
[`config.hpp`](../../firmware/flight-computer/include/flight/config.hpp) is the single
source of truth in code; this page and
[pico-gpio-map.md](../hardware/pico-gpio-map.md) must always agree with it.

> [!NOTE]
> **This map is built and measured, as of 2026-09-07.** Every signal on this page exists as
> solder on the vehicle board, and every device it names has answered: Gates 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7
> all pass ([bring-up record](../testing/bring-up-record.md)). **No regulator is fitted and none
> is needed** — every load runs from the Pico's own `3V3(OUT)`, which held **3.28–3.29 V through
> 45 back-to-back transmits** and 3.28–3.30 V at 100 % microSD write duty.
>
> **Three things on this page are still unbuilt**, and none of them is a signal: the sound
> module, the battery divider on `GP26`, and the switch and Schottky in the battery lead.
> **Until that Schottky exists, do not leave the battery connected while USB is plugged in** —
> `VBUS` reaches `VSYS` through the Pico's own `D1` and charges the pack with nothing
> controlling it ([D-6](../hardware/assembly-procedure.md#d-6-a-schottky-goes-between-the-switch-and-vsys)).

> [!NOTE]
> **Update 2026-10-02 — the wired vehicle has flown.** Two descents on 30 September 2026
> ([`analysis/flight-2026-09-30/`](../../analysis/flight-2026-09-30/), final report chapter 14)
> exercised this wiring in flight: the radio link, the barometer and IMU (altitude, attitude and
> acceleration through a 5.2 g throw), the GPS (a fix in every rich packet) and the sound
> input (`SN-` in the rich packets) all delivered data, and the vehicle survived the landings.
> The switch is now fitted — a rocker ON/OFF switch on short leads outside the frame — with the
> power LED. Photographs: `documentation/project/report-2026/figures/photos/pcb-top.jpg` (vehicle

## Ground station bridge signal wiring

The bridge Pico uses the same SPI pins as the vehicle, so one wiring habit covers both
boards. It has no sensors, no SD card and no GPS.

The bridge is powered and read over the same USB cable, so it needs no battery and no
regulator. The pin constants live in
[`firmware/ground-station/src/pico/main.cpp`](../../firmware/ground-station/src/pico/main.cpp)
and mirror `BoardPins`.

## Module header pinouts, as printed

Transcribed from the delivered boards on 2026-09-04, photographs in
[`documentation/hardware/photos/`](../hardware/photos/). **These are silkscreen labels, not
an interpretation of them** — where a board prints `CLK` this table says `CLK`, and where it
names a pin two ways it says both.

**SX1278 RA-02** — two rows of 8, read from the u.FL connector end:

```text
J2   GND   GND   3.3V   RST   DIO0   DIO1   DIO2   DIO3
J1   GND   NSS   MOSI   MISO   SCK   DIO5   DIO4   GND
```

> The supply pin is **third from the u.FL end, with `GND` immediately before it and `RST`
> immediately after.** Earlier revisions of this repository said `GND` sat on *both* sides of
> it; the transcription above says otherwise, and so does the warning that followed it. A
> one-pin offset is a fault in either direction — one way puts 3.3 V onto `RST`, the other puts
> the supply onto `GND`. Mark pin 1 on the board before wiring.

**MPU-9250 breakout** (`GY-6500 / GY-9250`, `V356`) — 10 pins:

```text
VCC   GND   SCL     SDA     EDA   ECL   AD0       INT   NCS   FSYNC
                  (SCLK)  (SDI)                 (SDO)
```

> The underside names `SCL/SCLK`, `SDA/SDI` and `ADD/SDO` — the second name in each pair is
> the SPI role. This project uses I2C, so `SCL`, `SDA` and `AD0` are the relevant names.
> `EDA`/`ECL` are the auxiliary master bus and stay unconnected.

**GY-BM(E/P)280** — 6 pins:

```text
VCC   GND   SCL   SDA   CSB   SDO
```

> Six pins, not the four of the I2C-only variant. `CSB` selects the interface and `SDO`
> selects the address; both carry 10 kΩ straps whose direction is not yet read.

**NEO-6M** (`GY-NEO6MV2`) — 4 pins:

```text
VCC   RX   TX   GND
```

> `RX` and `TX` name the **board's own** pins. The board's `TX` goes to the Pico's `RX` on
> GP13, and the board's `RX` to the Pico's `TX` on GP12 — which is what the pin table says,
> now confirmed against the silkscreen.

**microSD reader** — 6 pins:

```text
GND   MISO   CLK   MOSI   CS   3V3
```

> `CLK`, not `SCK`. Ground and supply are at opposite ends, so a reversed header is a direct
> short across the rail.

---

## Bus sharing rules

**I2C0 was designed for three devices and carries two.** On an MPU-9250 the magnetometer is
a separate AK8963 die at address `0x0C`, invisible until the firmware sets
`INT_PIN_CFG.BYPASS_EN` and bridges it onto the primary bus, after which it counts against
the bus's capacitance and pull-up budget like any other device. **The delivered IMU is an
MPU-6500 and `0x0C` never appears** — in either scan, with or without the bypass
([F-1](../hardware/receiving-inspection.md#findings), bring-up row 3.1). The third row below
is retained because it is what the bus must accommodate if a nine-axis part is ever fitted.

| Device | Address | Selected by |
|---|---|---|
| IMU accelerometer + gyroscope | `0x68` or `0x69` | AD0 strap |
| AK8963 magnetometer — **absent on the delivered part** | `0x0C` | Fixed; reachable only through the pass-through bridge |
| BMP280 | `0x76` or `0x77` | SDO strap |

All three are distinct whichever way the straps are fitted, so sharing the bus works — but
only if the pull-ups behave. **Both delivered breakouts carry their own, and both are 10 kΩ:**
five `103` resistors on the MPU-9250 board and four on the BMP280 board
([receiving-inspection.md C.3.5 and C.4.4](../hardware/receiving-inspection.md#part-c--per-board-identification)).
Two 10 kΩ pull-ups in parallel on each line is 5 kΩ — a legal bus, and a stiffer one than
either board was designed around. It sinks roughly 0.66 mA per line when a device pulls low,
which every part here can drive, but it is worth measuring rather than assuming.

The **strap directions are still unread**: which way AD0 and SDO are pulled decides `0x68`
versus `0x69` and `0x76` versus `0x77`, and no photograph shows it. The firmware and the
bring-up record both currently expect `0x68` and `0x76`. Check the straps with a meter, or
scan the bus, before treating those two addresses as facts.

**SPI0 — RA-02 and microSD share clock, MOSI and MISO.** Two rules make this safe:

1. Exactly one chip select may be asserted at a time. The RA-02 uses GP17 and the SD card
   uses GP6, and no code path drives both low.
2. A deselected device must release MISO. **On the delivered reader, nothing but the card
   itself does.** The board has no buffer and no translator — four 10 kΩ pull-ups and two
   capacitors are its entire parts list — so a card that keeps driving MISO corrupts the
   *radio's* next transaction, and the symptom looks like a dead radio. The pull-up defines
   an undriven line; it cannot overcome a driven one. This is bring-up row 7.4, and it is
   the most important row in the shared-bus gate.

The delivered reader's supply pin is printed `3V3` and it carries no regulator, so it runs
from the same 3.3 V rail as everything else on the vehicle. An earlier revision of this
document said the opposite — that the reader needed 4.5–5.5 V and a rail of its own — on the
strength of a supplier listing. The board that arrived does not agree with the listing, which
is precisely why this project photographs and inspects its boards before designing around
them.

Its header, in printed order, is **`GND  MISO  CLK  MOSI  CS  3V3`** — note `CLK`, not `SCK`,
and note that the supply pin is at the opposite end from ground.

What remains open for the reader is current, not voltage: an SD write transient is the
largest short-duration load on this vehicle and it lands on the same regulator as a radio
that transmits once a second. See
[sd-module-analysis.md](../hardware/sd-module-analysis.md).

```

**The second rail is gone.** The delivered microSD reader has no regulator and no level
shifter, and its supply pin is printed `3V3`. Every peripheral now sits on one 3.3 V rail.
The supplier listing describing a 4.5–5.5 V input and an onboard regulator did not describe
the board that arrived — see
[receiving-inspection.md, finding F-3](../hardware/receiving-inspection.md#findings).

Dashed boxes are undesigned. Two decisions still block the tree:

1. **No regulator is selected.** The AMS1117-3.3 was assessed and rejected for direct 1S
   LiPo to 3.3 V regulation — a fully charged cell at about 4.2 V does not clear its
   high-load dropout.
   See [electrical-architecture.md](electrical-architecture.md#ams1117-33-direct-regulation-assessment).
   The requirement is simpler than it was — one rail, not two — but it is not yet met.
2. **No ON/OFF switch and no power LED are in the BOM**, and both are mandatory
   competition items.

Three modules are verified 3.3 V-only. That removes the *supply* question for them and
tightens a different one: **with no level shifter anywhere in the vehicle, 3.3 V is a
requirement, not a convenience.** A 5 V feed onto this rail reaches the RA-02, the barometer
and the microSD card directly.

The MPU-9250 and NEO-6M each carry an unidentified SOT-23-5 regulator, so they may tolerate
more than 3.3 V. Neither is a reason to give them more.

The battery must be treated as a variable-voltage source across its discharge curve, never
as a fixed 3.7 V supply. **Neither of the delivered pack's connectors mates with anything in
this project** — a red JST-RCY main lead and a white 2-pin JST-XH balance lead — so the
switched distribution node begins with a purchase.

## Status LED and power indicator

```text
GP14 -> current-limiting resistor (value TBD) -> LED -> GND
```

Firmware drives GP14 high at the very start of `main()` and then blinks it at a rate that
encodes the mission state
([`Controller::update_led`](../../firmware/flight-computer/src/controller.cpp)):

| Mission state | LED behaviour |
|---|---|
| `INIT`, `SELF_TEST` | Solid on |
| `READY`, not yet armed | Slow blink, 900 ms half-period |
| `READY`, armed | Faster blink, 400 ms |
| `FLIGHT` | Fast blink, 100 ms |
| `LANDED`, `RECOVERY` | 250 ms |
| `FAULT` | Very fast blink, 60 ms |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a *status* LED driven by firmware. The competition also requires a **visible
> power indicator that lights immediately at power-on**. A GPIO-driven LED only lights
> once the RP2040 is running. Satisfying the requirement properly needs an LED branch on
> the switched battery node, which is still `TBD`.

## Battery monitoring

GP26 / ADC0 is no longer a bare reservation: **the divider is chosen, and the parts are
in hand.**

```text
  battery + ----[ 33 kΩ 1 % ]----+----[ 33 kΩ 1 % ]---- GND
                                 |
                                 +---- GP26 (ADC0)
```

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Ratio | **2 : 1** — `battery_divider_ratio = 2.0` |
| `GP26` at a full 4.20 V cell | **2.10 V**, against a 3.3 V input limit |
| `GP26` at a 3.0 V cutoff cell | 1.50 V |
| Current drawn from the battery | **64 µA**, continuous |
| Tolerance | ±1 % on each leg |

**Use the 33 kΩ 1 % parts, not the 100 kΩ 5 % ones**, even though both arrived and both give
the same ratio. The battery voltage is the one telemetry quantity nothing else can
cross-check — an altitude can be argued against a GPS fix, an attitude against gravity, but a
pack voltage is only ever as good as the divider under it. A fifth of the tolerance for
43 µA more is a trade worth making.

**Fit both legs before powering anything.** A divider with its lower leg missing puts the
full pack voltage on `GP26`, and 4.2 V on a 3.3 V input is how an RP2040 dies.

### GP27 and GP15 — the LM393 sound module

**Count the pins on the module before wiring it.** The LM393 sound detection sensor is sold
in two forms under one name, and they are not interchangeable:

| Pins | Outputs | What this vehicle gets |
|---|---|---|
| **4** — `VCC GND DO AO` | comparator **and** analogue | Both channels. Wire `AO` to GP27 and `DO` to GP15 |
| **3** — `VCC GND OUT` | comparator only | `OUT` is `DO`. Wire it to GP15 and leave GP27 unconnected |

If the board has only three pins, set `sound_analog_connected = false` in the configuration.
That matters: **an unconnected ADC pin does not read zero, it floats**, and a floating input
produces a plausible-looking level that no microphone measured. The flag is how the log
avoids recording it.

`DO` is pulled down in firmware, so leaving it unwired reads as a constant "not asserted"
rather than drifting. Set `sound_gate_connected = false` as well if you only wire `AO`, so
the column stays blank instead of reading a truthful-looking 0.0 %.

An additional sensor, and wired directly: the module's `AO` output already swings inside
0–3.3 V, so no divider is needed and none should be fitted — one would halve the signal for
nothing. Take `AO`, not `DO`. The digital output is a comparator against the trimpot and
carries one bit; the analogue output is the level this vehicle logs.

**The module must be a 3.3 V part.** There is no level shifter anywhere on this vehicle, and
a 5 V module's output swing would exceed the RP2040's absolute maximum on an ADC pin.

Three notes that matter more than the wiring:

- **The trimpot sets the gain, and nothing records where it was left.** Two flights at
  different trimpot positions produce numbers that cannot be compared. Set it once, mark it,
  and write the position in the flight log.
- **Route `AO` away from SPI0 and the antenna lead.** It is a high-impedance analogue line
  next to a 4 MHz clock and a transmitting PA, and it will pick up both. Keep it short, keep
  it off the SPI bundle, and give it a ground return of its own if the layout allows.
- **A disconnected input floats and still produces a level.** That is why the driver keeps
  the window's raw minimum and maximum, not only the span: a window pinned near a rail is a
  wire, not a sound.

The firmware is written to make an unsafe assumption impossible:
`BoardIo::battery_voltage()` returns the **raw pin voltage**, implementations must not
pre-scale, and `Configuration::battery_divider_ratio` defaults to `0.0f`, which means the
controller reports the raw pin voltage unscaled and the low-battery fault stays disabled.
A real voltage is only ever reported once a measured divider ratio `(R1 + R2) / R2` is
entered.

> [!CAUTION]
> Never connect the LiPo directly to GP26. The RP2040 ADC input is limited to the 3.3 V
> rail, and a charged 1S cell is about 4.2 V.

## RF chain

```text
RA-02 module  ->  IPEX (u.FL) connector
              ->  10 cm IPEX-to-SMA RG1.13 cable
              ->  433 MHz antenna
```

**The chain has been assembled and fits.** Antenna, cable and module were mated hand-tight on
2026-09-04 with no adapter — photograph
[`1150780-ra02-antenna-mated.jpg`](../hardware/photos/1150780-ra02-antenna-mated.jpg). The
RA-02's connector is a u.FL socket and the cable's is the matching IPEX-1 plug.

Three notes:

- **The connector nomenclature is still open, but assembly is not.** The antenna's shell is
  female and the cable's is male, which agrees with the supplier listing's gender and
  contradicts the BOM's "SMA male". Whether the pair is SMA or RP-SMA depends on the centre
  contacts, which no photograph shows. This matters when a *replacement* antenna is ordered:
  an RP-SMA antenna screws onto an SMA pigtail perfectly and connects nothing.
- **The cable is a bulkhead part**, supplied with a nut and star washer, so it is meant to be
  panel-mounted through the airframe wall. That mount is also the strain relief — plan the
  hole rather than leaving the joint hanging on 10 cm of coax.
- **Never power a LoRa module without its antenna attached.** Transmitting into an open
  connector can damage the output stage.

The module's shield states `PA:+18dBm`, which is the module's PA capability rather than the
configured output. What is actually transmitted comes from `link_profile.hpp` below. The two
are not in conflict, but the 1 dB is worth knowing before a range measurement gets read as a
link-budget failure.

Radio parameters — 433 MHz, **SF7**, 125 kHz bandwidth, coding rate 4/5, 17 dBm, CRC on — live
in one place, [`cansat/link_profile.hpp`](../../firmware/common/include/cansat/link_profile.hpp),
read by both the vehicle and the ground-station bridge. The spreading factor is set by
airtime, not preference: see [link-budget.md](link-budget.md). Only the sync words are fixed
by the rulebook: **`0xF3` for testing, `0xA5` for the official launch.**

## Bring-up order

Wire and verify one subsystem at a time. Do not connect everything and power on.

## Module mounting

Decided 2026-09-05, before the first joint was made. Two modules are permanent, four stay
removable, and the split follows the spares rather than the wiring.

| Module | Delivered | Mounting | Why |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Raspberry Pi Pico | 2 | **Header pins through the board, soldered** | Headers were fitted on 2026-09-04, so flat castellation mounting was already off the table. A spare Pico is in the drawer |
| SX1278 RA-02 | 2 | **Soldered** | One of the two modules whose supply jumper caused [F-10](../testing/bring-up-record.md#findings). Soldering it removes that wire entirely. A spare RA-02 is in the drawer |
| microSD reader | 1 | **Soldered**, revised 2026-09-06 | Its supply jumper is the only wire on this project that has actually failed. Soldering deletes [F-10](../testing/bring-up-record.md#findings) rather than decoupling around it, and the part swapped in service is the card, not the reader |
| MPU-6500 IMU | 1 | Jumpered | No spare |
| GY-BMP280 | 1 | Jumpered | No spare |
| NEO-6M GPS | 1 | Jumpered | No spare |

The two modules held in duplicate are permanent because a spare exists. **The microSD reader
is permanent for the opposite reason** — not because losing it is cheap, but because the wire
it would otherwise hang on is the one this project has already watched fail. A destroyed RA-02
costs a module from the drawer. A destroyed IMU costs the mission, and there is no second one
to fit.

### What the soldered microSD requires

[F-10](../testing/bring-up-record.md#findings) was a long supply jumper: **every** microSD
write failed while **every** read passed, across five bench runs, appearing and vanishing with
the seating. **Revised 2026-09-06: the reader is soldered down**, which removes that wire
entirely rather than asking a capacitor to stand in for it.

Two rules survive the change, and one requirement arrives with it:

- **The bulk pair and the 100 nF still go on the microSD module's own `3V3` and `GND` pins.**
  A soldered track is shorter than a jumper, but the write spike still wants its charge
  locally, and a capacitor at the perfboard end has the whole track between itself and the
  current it is meant to supply.
- **The supply track is the shortest and most direct run on the board.** Length was never the
  whole of [F-10](../testing/bring-up-record.md#findings) — two crimps and two contact
  interfaces were — but the rule costs nothing to keep.
- **The card slot must reach an opening in the airframe.** The flight log is recovered off that
  card, and a reader soldered inside a sealed body with its slot facing inward loses it.

The same rule applies at smaller stakes to the 100 nF at the IMU, barometer and GPS: module
end, at the pins. Values and reasoning are in
[electrical-architecture.md](electrical-architecture.md#decoupling).

### What jumpers add mechanically

Four modules on flying leads are four more things that can come loose on a vehicle that is
launched and lands hard. The [electrical risk table](electrical-architecture.md#electrical-risks)
already carries impact opening a connector as a failure mode; jumpers make it four times.

- **Retention on every jumper.** Dupont shells back out under vibration on their own. Each
  needs heat-shrink or a tie at the shell, and an anchor so mechanical load never reaches the
  connector.
- **The IMU must be rigidly bonded to the structure regardless of its wiring.** Attitude is
  referenced to the airframe, so a module that moves relative to the structure degrades roll
  and pitch directly — and with no magnetometer on the delivered part
  ([F-1](../hardware/receiving-inspection.md#findings)) there is no second reference to catch
  it. The jumper solves the electrical connection and nothing else.
- **The GPS patch antenna faces skyward** wherever the module ends up.

### Still open

How the jumper's board end lands is not decided. Male header strips soldered into the
perfboard give a plug field and keep both ends serviceable; wire soldered straight into the
pad has one fewer connector per line to shake loose but makes the board end permanent. The
current intent is header strips for the four signal groups and soldered wire for the
microSD's supply pair.
