# Telemetry cadence and the max-rate command — design

**Status: revised and approved 2026-09-11 and implemented the same day, then revised again the
same day for the organizers' ground station — a 200-byte packet limit and sync word `0xA5`.
`MAX_RATE` was measured on the bench at 3.11 Hz on the previous slots. Update 2026-10-02: the
final slot pattern was then measured in flight on 30 September 2026 — 3.09 Hz on the vehicle
clock, gaps 0.374 / 0.296 / 0.297 s — see [Measured in flight](#measured-in-flight).** This replaces the 2026-09-10 design of two max-rate commands. The packet
widths were corrected by measurement the same day — see [where the numbers come
from](#where-the-numbers-come-from). The bench rows under Gate 8 of the [bring-up
record](../testing/bring-up-record.md) were what would make any of it real; the flight record
below now does.

## Why the packet changes

The rulebook rewards extra sensors in one place and conditions it in another:

> **Sensor Integration:** "Additional Working Sensors (5 Points each, up to 25 Points)."
>
> **Data Transmission Guidelines, note 5:** "Extra sensors will be rewarded under the
> Sensors & Innovation scoring section, but only if data is correctly formatted and
> consistently transmitted."

The two read differently, and the organizers settled it on 2026-09-11: **only transmitted
telemetry is considered for extra-sensor points.** Until this design, neither the GPS nor
the sound sensor was transmitted in normal flight — both went to the SD log only — so under
that ruling both scored nothing unless an operator pressed a button.

The requirement that follows: **GPS and sound on the air at least once a second, in every
mode, and the mandatory data as fast as the link allows.**

## Two packet shapes

| Shape | Carries | Worst case |
|---|---|---:|
| **Rich** | The twelve mandatory fields, then `GP-Lat`, `GP-Lon`, `GP-Alt`, then `SN-` | **209 B**, held to **200 B** on the air |
| **Lean** | The twelve mandatory fields only | **147 B** |

`SN-` is the sound level in millivolts peak-to-peak, one decimal — a short prefix, as the
rulebook asks of optional fields. It tops out at `SN-3300.0`, the ADC reference.

A field is only transmitted when its data is valid: a rich packet from a vehicle with no GPS
fix carries `SN-` alone, and one with a stale microphone carries `GP-` alone. The SD row
always records everything, whichever shape went on the air.

**The five diagnostic tags — `MODE`, `FAULTS`, `CAL`, `ARM`, `YR` — leave the air by
default, in every mode.** They are project-local, the rulebook's mandated packet does not
contain them, and there is no room for them: at their widest, tags, GPS and sound together are
263 bytes — past the 255-byte FIFO, let alone the organizers' 200. They continue to reach the
SD log, and a bench build can turn them back on — the controller sheds them first whenever
they do not fit.

## Normal flight

**Every packet is rich.** At the 700 ms cadence a sensor reading at least once a second means
every packet has to carry one — alternating rich and lean would put the sensors at 0.71 Hz.

| | |
|---|---:|
| Period | 700 ms (unchanged) |
| Packet rate | **1.43 Hz** (unchanged) |
| GPS and sound rate | **1.43 Hz** |
| Duty at the 200-byte budget | **46.2 %** measured, 45.4 % modelled — under the 50 % cap |

## The max-rate command

One command, `MAX_RATE`, replacing the two of the previous design. The same envelope, the same
token scheme and the same replay rules, accepted only during the pre-arm [command
window](#the-command-window):

```text
CAN-Team-25; CMD-MAX_RATE; PN-1234; KEY-<16 hex>;
```

**The token covers the command**, which the previous design established: FNV-1a over
`password | COMMAND | packet_number`, so a token minted for one command is refused for every
other. The fixture is regenerated for the new command name.

After it, the vehicle transmits a repeating pattern of three:

| Slot | Shape | Length |
|---|---|---:|
| 1 | rich | **374 ms** |
| 2 | lean | **296 ms** |
| 3 | lean | **296 ms** |
| **Cycle** | | **966 ms** |

| | |
|---|---:|
| Packet rate | **3.11 Hz** |
| GPS and sound rate | **1.04 Hz** — one rich packet every 966 ms |
| Duty | **84 %** |

A fourth lean slot would take the cycle to 1262 ms and the sensors below 1 Hz, so three is
not a choice but the largest pattern that keeps the requirement.

## Where the numbers come from

Every slot is **measured airtime + 50 ms, rounded up**:

| Bytes | Airtime, model | +1.8 % measured | + 50 ms | Slot |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 147 | 240.90 ms | 245.23 ms | 295.23 | **296 ms** |
| 200 | 317.70 ms | 323.41 ms | 373.41 | **374 ms** |

The 1.8 % is this hardware's measured excess over the model (bring-up rows 5.2 and 5.3). The
rich slot is sized for 200 bytes, the budget, because no longer rich packet is ever sent. The
50 ms covers two jobs in the same gap. One is the vehicle's own work between two transmits: one SD block write at its measured
worst case — 30 ms, on two boards, in two of five sessions
([F-11](../testing/bring-up-record.md#findings)), a healthy card's housekeeping rather than
a fault — plus the sensor loop and the watchdog feed. The rulebook scores consistency on the
same five points as rate, so a slot inside that guard buys rate by making packets late. The
other is the organizers' receiver, deaf for about 35 ms after each packet while it prints it
([below](#the-organizers-ground-station)). 40 ms, the previous guard, covered the card and
not that. Since the transmit stopped blocking the card write happens while the packet is on the
air, so the receiver is now what the guard is for.

**The byte figures are defended by construction, not by arithmetic.** A test builds the
widest packet each shape can produce — the rulebook's fixed-width team id, packet number
4294967295, a 99:59:59:999 mission clock, the extreme negative values the overflow test uses,
and every optional field at its widest — and checks it against its constant:

| Part | Bytes |
|---|---:|
| Mandatory fields | 147 |
| `GP-Lat` + `GP-Lon` + `GP-Alt`, with separators | 51 |
| `SN-3300.0`, with separator | 11 |
| **Rich**, all three at their widest | **209** |
| **Budget**, the most any packet may carry | **200** |

**That test corrected this document.** Its first revision carried 145, 56 and 212 from a
commit message, and the construction said 147, 55 and 213. The rich packet's change is
harmless — 212 and 213 bytes share a LoRa symbol block. The lean packet's is not: 147 bytes
crosses a symbol boundary that 145 does not, 43 blocks against 42, which is 5 ms of airtime
on every lean packet. It moved the lean slot from 281 to 286 ms, the cycle from 947 to 957,
and the rate from 3.17 to 3.13 Hz.

**The organizers' receiver corrected it again.** At 6 decimals of latitude and longitude and
1 of altitude the GPS block was 55 bytes, and mandatory + GPS was 202 — over their 200. Printed
to what the NEO-6M resolves, 5 decimals (1.1 m) and whole metres, it is 51, and mandatory +
GPS is 198. Sound does not fit beside them at their widest (209), so the controller sheds `SN-`
from any packet that would pass 200; every rich packet of the 2026-09-10 range test had more
than 20 bytes to spare. The SD row keeps 6 decimals and 1.

`static_assert`s in `link_profile.hpp` refuse a build where any slot is inside its own
airtime plus the guard, where the max-rate cycle exceeds 1000 ms, where a fourth lean slot
would still fit, where the budget passes the organizers' 200 bytes, or where mandatory + GPS
does not fit the budget at their widest.

## The organizers' ground station

The team was given the organizers' receiver code on 2026-09-11: an ESP32 running the
arduino-LoRa library at 433 MHz, SF7, 125 kHz, CR 4/5, CRC on, sync word `0xA5`. Three things
in it bind this design.

| In their receiver | What it does to a packet | What the vehicle does about it |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_PACKET_SIZE 200`; a packet with `packetSize > 200` is discarded | A 201-byte packet is printed as an error and never scored | The budget is 200. GPS printed to 5 decimals and whole metres; `SN-` shed first when a packet would pass it; `validate_config()` refuses a flight budget above it |
| `LoRa.setSyncWord(0xA5)` | Packets on any other word are not received, apart from the few a sync filter lets through | Both Picos fly `0xA5` |
| After each packet: standby while about 374 characters print at 115200 baud, then `LoRa.receive()` | About 35 ms deaf after every packet | A 50 ms guard between packets, where 40 ms used to be |

**The 2026-09-10 range test is the evidence.** The organizers' station received a few packets
at a slower rate while the team's own received every one. The SD log from that day shows every
packet was 184 bytes or less, so the size limit did not bite — the vehicle was on `0xF3`. The
size limit would have bitten at the launch, on a wide packet carrying a fix. Neither can happen
now.

**Their dead time per packet is an estimate, not a measurement** — the print volume over the
line rate. The 30 September flights were received by their station at the 50 ms guard and the
max-rate pattern (see [Measured in flight](#measured-in-flight)); the dead time itself was
not measured separately.

## The command window

The old window was READY with `ARM-0`, and on a desk the vehicle calibrates and arms about three
seconds after power-on. That closed the window before an operator could use it — which is what
the bench fallback turned out to be. The window is now its own phase:

1. **A clean power-on opens it**, on a build with the uplink. It lasts `command_window_ms`, five
   minutes. The vehicle transmits, listens, calibrates once for a working height reference, and
   **does not arm**.
2. **An accepted `MAX_RATE` or the timeout closes it**, whichever is first. An erase does not.
3. **Closing it discards the power-on calibration.** The vehicle recalibrates where it now sits
   — on the pad, after the operator has finished with it — and arms when that settles and the
   3 s arming delay, counted from the close, has run.
4. **A watchdog reset skips it.** A reset may come mid-flight, and five minutes unarmed and
   listening would be five minutes without launch or landing detection.
5. **A build without `local_secrets.hpp` has no uplink and no window**, and arms three seconds
   after power-on exactly as before. The password lives in that gitignored file; the build
   refuses the template's `SET-ME` and anything under eight characters. The team flies `change-me`.

**What flew.** The vehicle was powered at the ground floor (Flight 1, 18:14:34 IST), the
five-minute window closed and it armed at about 18:19, then it was carried up the building. A
watchdog restart after Flight 1 skipped the window as designed (point 4): telemetry restarted
at packet 1 already in the max-rate pattern. Flight 2 was powered at the terrace and was still
in the 1.43 Hz command window (`ST-R003`) when thrown.

**The operator sees arming in the `ST-` status field**, on every rich packet. The console also
estimates the window from the mission clock in every packet, and labels that an estimate. **A launch inside
the window is not detected**, so the drone waits for the vehicle to arm.

## Measured in flight

On 30 September 2026 the pattern ran on the real vehicle and was received by the organizers'
station (analysis in [`analysis/flight-2026-09-30/`](../../analysis/flight-2026-09-30/); final
report chapter 14).

| Quantity | Designed | Measured, Flight 1 |
|---|---|---|
| Cadence | 966 ms cycle, 3.11 Hz nominal | **3.09 Hz** on the received packets |
| Gaps | 374 + 296 + 296 ms | **0.374 / 0.296 / 0.297 s** — the pattern reproduced exactly |
| Packet size | 200-byte budget; 209 / 147 widest | **≤ 188 B** (rich 136–188 B, lean 118–130 B) |
| Packets received | — | 41 in Flight 1, 18 in Flight 2, 41 in the 12.95 s after Flight 1 |

The 3.09 Hz figure is the one the bench note above anticipated ("about 3.09 if the station reads
0.6 % low"); on the vehicle clock the gaps match the slots to the millisecond, so the pattern is
the vehicle's and not the station's. The pattern ran under the real load of flight, with GPS
fixes in every rich packet. No packet exceeded the organizers' 200-byte limit, and the
`ST-` field showed the state live (`ST-F111`: FLIGHT, armed, calibrated, 1 fault, for the whole
record of Flight 1). The window design behaved as written: it closed, the vehicle recalibrated and
armed, and a watchdog reset skipped it. Flight 2 was thrown while still in the command window
at 1.43 Hz, which is what the "a launch inside the window is not detected" warning above
describes; it is not a pattern measurement.

## What latches

One accepted `MAX_RATE` sets, permanently for the power cycle:

1. **The schedule** — the telemetry task moves from a fixed 700 ms period to the three-slot
   pattern. `PeriodicTask` gains a way to set the *next* due time from the slot of the packet
   just sent, because a rich slot and a lean slot are different lengths.
2. **The uplink** — `service_ground_commands()` returns immediately from then on. The vehicle
   never enters RX again, so the command cannot be repeated or undone.
3. **The report** — `HealthSnapshot::rate_maxed`, printed on the startup summary's state line.

The packet *shapes* do not change at the latch — both modes transmit rich packets and carry
no tags. The command changes only how often, and whether two lean packets follow each rich
one.

**The latch lives in RAM.** A power cycle or watchdog reset returns the flashed schedule. A
card carrying "max rate, no uplink" from a bench session must never apply itself silently to
a flight.

## What the ground side learns

Both parsers already store unknown optional fields generically, so nothing breaks — but
nothing displays `SN-` either, so:

- **Python** (`telemetry.py`): a `sound_mv` accessor, and a `sound_mv` column in the CSV.
- **JavaScript** (`index.html`): `rec.sound_mv`, a sound readout on the console, and the column
  in the console's CSV export.
- **Both**: rows in `test-data/optional-tag-cases.tsv` for `SN-`, so the two cannot disagree.
- **The console**: one **Max rate** button replacing two, with a prompt stating about
  3.11 packets a second, GPS and sound once a second, and that it cannot be undone.

## Validation

`validate_config()`'s rule that "`transmit_gps` needs a 255-byte budget" assumed the tags were
always on the air. It is replaced by a computed floor: the budget must be at least

```text
147 + (transmit_gps ? 51 : 0)
```

**The failure this guards against is silent.** A budget too small for the sensors has the
controller shed GPS and sound from every packet to fit it, the duty check passes on a packet
that is never sent, and the extra-sensor points — scored only on what is transmitted — go to
zero with no fault anywhere.

**The diagnostic tags are deliberately not counted.** The first revision of this design
counted them, which would have refused any tagged configuration outright — including the
end-to-end fixture that proves `MODE` crosses the whole ground pipeline. There is no
protective reason to: the controller sheds the tags first whenever a packet would not fit,
so they can never push the sensors off the air.

**Nor is sound, since the 200-byte budget.** Mandatory + GPS + sound are 209 bytes at their
widest, so counting sound would refuse every configuration that transmits it. The controller
sheds it a packet at a time instead, and only from a packet whose other fields are at widths
no flight produces together.

**And a flight budget may not pass 200.** `validate_config()` refuses `worst_case_packet_bytes`
above the organizers' limit unless the diagnostic tags are on the air — a bench build, heard
by the team's own bridge alone.

## Consequences accepted

| | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Live mission state on the console** | **Back since 2026-09-11, about once a second.** The `ST-` status field — state, armed, calibrated and active faults in nine bytes — rides on every rich packet it fits, and the console holds it through the lean ones. The full diagnostic tags stay off the air |
| **The SD log** | Becomes the only in-flight record of mission state, faults and calibration. The bench vehicle reported **`SD card FAILED`** when this was written (2026-09-11), which mattered more under this design than before it |
| **Log capacity** | ~30 hours at 1.43 Hz; ~13.7 hours after `MAX_RATE` |
| **Average current** | Normal flight moves ~41 → ~43 mA for the radio. After `MAX_RATE`, ~76 mA. Peaks unchanged — they are set by coincident TX, SD write and GPS acquisition, not by rate |
| **Channel occupancy** | 46 % in normal flight; 84 % after `MAX_RATE`. Acceptable in a reserved launch slot. Both Picos are on `0xA5`, every team's launch word, so the vehicle must be off during other teams' launches — which the rulebook requires anyway |
| **Format compliance** | The twelve mandatory fields are untouched and always first; `GP-` and `SN-` are optional fields with short prefixes, which is what the rulebook's *Optional Sensor Fields* section describes |

## Testing

**C++:** the widest rich and lean packets match 209 and 147 by construction, and the widest
rich one fits 200 without `SN-`; both slots clear
their airtime plus the guard; the max-rate cycle is under 1000 ms and a fourth slot is not;
normal flight transmits `GP-` and `SN-` in every packet and no tags; after `MAX_RATE` the
pattern is rich, lean, lean with the right spacing and the SD row still carries GPS and sound
for lean packets; the uplink closes; the command is refused when armed, out of READY,
replayed, or minted for another command; a flight build never polls the radio;
`validate_config()` refuses a budget below mandatory + GPS or a flight budget above 200, and
accepts a tagged bench build.

**Python and Node:** `SN-` parses to the same key and value in both, from the shared fixture;
`sound_mv` reaches both CSVs; the console mints a `MAX_RATE` token the fixture agrees with.

**Documented claims:** 200, 209, 147, both slots, the 966 ms cycle, 3.11 Hz and 1.04 Hz enter
`check_doc_claims.py` derived from the shipped constants.

**Bench, on hardware** (the open fallback was settled on 2026-09-11, and the pattern flew on
2026-09-30, see [Measured in flight](#measured-in-flight)): normal flight shows `GP-` and `SN-` in every packet at 1.43 Hz; `MAX_RATE` moves the
station to ~3.11 Hz (about 3.09 if the station reads 0.6 % low, as it did on the previous
slots) with a rich packet every ~966 ms; the organizers' code on an ESP32 receives every packet; no gaps in numbering over two minutes;
a power cycle restores 1.43 Hz.

## Decisions recorded

- **Sensors on the air in every mode.** The organizers' ruling makes any mode that does not
  transmit them a mode that does not score them.
- **Every normal-flight packet is rich.** Alternating would put the sensors at 0.71 Hz.
- **Tags leave the air by default.** There is no byte budget that holds tags, GPS and sound
  together.
- **Widths by construction.** A commit message's arithmetic was 2 bytes short on the mandatory
  block, and 2 bytes was a whole LoRa symbol block.
- **The floor counts only what must reach the air.** Tags are shed first and cannot displace
  the sensors, so counting them protects nothing and forbids tagged bench builds.
- **One command, not two.** The lean variant's only advantage was dropping GPS, which the
  ruling now makes costly.
- **A slot per packet shape, not one period.** A rich packet needs 374 ms and a lean one 296;
  one period sized for the rich packet would waste 78 ms on every lean one.
- **200 bytes, because the organizers' station drops anything longer.** It is their station
  that scores, whatever the team's own bridge can hear.
- **A 50 ms guard**, because their receiver is deaf for about 35 ms after each packet.
- **Sync word `0xA5` on both Picos, for testing as well as the launch.** Their station listens
  on nothing else.
- **A pre-arm command window, not one gated on `ARM-0`.** Arming three seconds after power-on
  closed the old window before anyone could use it. Five minutes of listening, then
  recalibration and arming, is a window an operator can actually use — and a launch inside it
  is not detected, which the runbook says in bold.
- **The sealed build does not wait for the button** (2026-09-11). With the USB port closed a
  missed press, or a watchdog reset in flight, could never be reflashed away, so
  `auto_max_rate` engages the pattern when the window closes, or at once when there is no
  window. The window stays at 700 ms: a command takes ~110 ms on the air and no max-rate gap
  is that long. `MAX_RATE` now only closes the window early.
- **RAM latch, token bound to the command.** Unchanged from the previous design, for the same
  reasons.

## Out of scope

Persisting the latch. Commanding in flight. Changing bandwidth or spreading factor. Raising the
normal-flight rate. Putting the diagnostic tags back on the air in normal flight.
